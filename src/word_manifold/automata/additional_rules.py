"""
Additional Cellular Automata Rules Module for Word Vector Space.

This module complements the base cellular_rules.py by providing additional rule
definitions and sequences that expand the system's capabilities. It particularly
focuses on astral and cosmic correspondences, completing the Star rule and adding
related transformations based on celestial bodies and higher mystical concepts.

As above, so below: The rules in this module operate primarily in the realm of 
higher abstract principles (divine/astral) while manifesting concrete transformations
in the vector space (physical).
