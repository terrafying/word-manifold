Liber Ale 
	 Wisdom or Folly 
93, Do What Thou Wilt Shall Be the Whole of the Law. 
As the Earth revolves around the Sun, so the Sun also 
revolves around a central or Galactic Sup, passing through 
each 30 degree arc or its orbit every 2000 . 	Earth years. 
Thus it happens that the vibrations channeled onto the 
Earth through the Sun from this creative center undergo 
subtle changes and on the Earth the Aeons Progress. 
With each such progression new intelligences and forces 
become prominent and operative, old formulae are re-
placed by new, and fresh patterns of manifestation become 
not only possible, but desirable. At this time, the Equinox 
of the Gods, a new Law is proclaimed on Earth to men by 
an Adept of the Grade of Magus. New evolutionary pat-
terns then begin to permeate the lower planes, changing 
the ideas and activities of each in conformity with the new 
Law. 
It was at the beginning of the period of transition from 
Piscean to Aquarian influences that Aleister Crowley inter-
sected this vibration while operating on unusually high 
spiritual planes for a Western man of his time, and began 
the task of channeling these vibrations to those working 
the lower planes. The Book of the Law was dictated to 
him in 1904 by Aiwass, the messenger of Horus, and desig-
nated him as To MegaTherion, the Magus of the New Age. 
The Aquarian vibration has had apocalyptic effect on 
each level it has manifested, revitalizing the Spiritual plane 
and challenging the antiquated reasoning of Piscean Age 
science and religion. On the spiritual plane, the formula 
"I believe" has been replaced by "I know" Drugs such as 
LSD used as sacrame -nts have opened the spiritual eyes of 
many Aspirants. On the mental or conceptual levels New-
tonian mechanics and classical physics have been replaced 
by quantum mechanics and relativistic theory. The Age of 
Horseback has become the Age of Space exploration. 
Crowley did much in his writing to further spread the 
Word of this great change to as many levels as possible in 
his lifetime. 
During his later years Crowley's sexual workings were 
primarily concerned with opening a corridor through the 
star-ways for the new family of human beings that is to 
replace the soul/family still working the Piscean formula 
here. This new group is to begin using the planet Earth as 
the setting for the new Aquarian myths, continuing ac-
tivity with its own karmic adventure. Such people are to 
be the first physical manifestation of this incoming vibra-
tion. As above, so below. 
In a sense, this family of Aquarian personalities was 
fathered by Aleister Crowley. It is through the work of 
these children that the face of the Earth itself will be 
changed in conformity with the new Karmic pattern. For 
these children Aleister Crowley wrote Liber -4 leph, the 
Book of Wisdom or Folly, a holy book which we present 
in its second edition as a guide through this dangerous and 
unbalanced time of rapid change always present at the be-
ginning of a new Aeon.

INTRODUCTION 
This book has had a strange fate. It is one of the mas- 
terworks of the late Aleister Crowley, completed at the end 
of the First World War, in March of 1918, when the Central 
Powers were crumbling. On several occasions it was attempted 
to publish it; twice before it was actualty set to print. The 
Last time, the printing was completed in England, but the 
author's death on December 1st of 1947 intervened, and the 
edition was not issued. 
This is one of Crowley's greatest and deepest books, into 
which he put his very blood. There is no better way to show 
the why and how the book was written than to let the author 
explain it himself. We quote from his as yet unpublished Con- 
fessions: 
"Liber Aleph, the Book of Wisdom, or Folly, was intended 
to express the heart of my &latrine in the most deep and del- 
icate dimensions. It is the most tense and intense book that 
have ever composed. The thought is so concentrated, and, 
if I may use the word, nervous, that both to write then, and 
to read now, involved and involves an almost unbearable 
strain. I remember how I used to sit at my desk night after 
night — it was the bitterest winter that had been known in New 
York for many years, but even if the central heating had been 
the flames of Hell itself, I doubt whether I should have been 
wr m. Night after night I sat, all through, rigid as a corpse, 
and icier; the whole of my life concentrated in two spots: the 
small section of my brain which was occupied in the work, 
and my right wrist and fingers. I remember with absolute 
clearness that my consciousness appeared to start from a per- 
fectly dead forearm. 
"The book is written in rose, yet there is a formal cir- 
cumscription more imminent than anything which would have 
been possible in poetry. I limited ?myself by nwelcing a point 
of dealing thoroughly with a given subject in a single page. 
It was an acute agony, similar to that of Asana, to write, and 
the effort removed me so far from normal human conscious-
ness, that there was something indiciblv ghastly in its natu-
ralness when 1 got into bed in full daylight in the hope of 
acquiring a particle of warmth from the complacent 'Camel." 
When he began writing Liber Ale ph, Crowley thought he 
was addressing it to his magical "son" O.I.V.V.I.O., whom he 
then believed would be the child prophesied in the Book of 
the Law. In several ways he strove to help this "son" in his 
progress. Thereby he was fulfilling the very prophecy in the 
Book: 
'It shall be his child and that strangely. 
Let him not seek after this; for thereby 
alone can he fall from it.' AL 111, 47. 
Up to 1919, events allowed Crowley to persist in his belief 
that 0. 1. V. V. 1. 0. would be the "child" promised in AL (Al-
though in the .Samadhic writing of Liber Ale ph itself he had 
foreseen - see Chapter 166 - the Truth of this matter). 
From then on, things began to happen that forced Crowley to 
become doubtful against his every wish and hope. By 1924 it 
became conclusive that O.I.V.V.I.O. (motto of the "son" on 
assuming the grade of Magister Templi) had failed to anni-
hilate the personality completely. 
But what mattered this to the Secret Chiefs, who spun 
their web about the Scribe so that, motivated by all the wealth 
of love in his nature, he should strain in this mighty effort? 
For, in one sense, Lib" Ale ph is addressed to the child of 
The Great Wild Beast, and the child of Man is mankind; and 
in another sense, the child promised in AL shall vet arise 
in its own good time. 
Therefore, for that child, and its brothers and sisters 
everywhere, we are now issuing this Work at a time when the 
sense of frustration in all continents of the globe has led al-
most to a vision of complete Chaos.

LIBER ALEPH VEL CXI 
APOLOGIA 
IHAVE begotten thee, o my Son, and that strangely, as 
thou knowest, upon the Scarlet Woman called Hilarion, 
as it was mysteriously foretold unto me in the Book of the 
Law. Now therefore that thou art come to the Age of Un-
derstanding, do thou give ear unto my Wisdom, for that 
therein lieth a simple and a direct Way for every Man that 
he may attain to the End. 
Firstly, then, I would have thee to know that Spiritual 
Experience and Perfection have no necessary Connexion 
with Advancement in our Holy Order. But for each Man 
is a Path: there is a Constant, and there is a Variable. 
Seek ever therefore in thy Work of the Promulgation of 
the Law to discover in each Man his own true Nature. 
For in each Man his Inmost Light is the Core of his Star, 
that is, Hadit; and his Work is the Identification of himself 
with that Light. 
It is not every Man who is called to the sublime Task 
of the A.•. A.•., wherein he must master thoroughly every 
Detail of the Great Work, so that he may in due Season 
accomplish it not only for himself, but for all who are 
bound unto him. There are very many for whom in their 
present Incarnations this Great Work may be impossible; 
since their appointed Work may be in Satisfaction of some 
Magical Debt, or in Adjustment of some Balance, or in 
Fulfilment of some Defect. As it is written: Suum Cuique. 
Now because thou art the Child of my Bowels I yearn 
greatly toward thee, o my Son, and I strive strongly with 
my Spirit that by my Wisdom I may make plain thy 
Way before Thee; and thus in many Chapters will I write 
for thee those Things that may profit thee. Sis bene-
dictus. 
1 
DE ARTE KABBALISTICA 
DO thou study most constantly, my Son, in the Art of the 
Holy Qabalah. Know that herein the Relations be-
tween Numbers, though they be mighty in Power and 
prodigal of Knowledge, are but lesser Things. For the 
Work is to reduce all other Conceptions to these of Num-
ber, because thus thou wilt lay bare the very Structure of 
thy Mind, whose rule is Necessity rather than Prejudice. 
Not until the Universe is thus laid naked before thee canst 
thou truly anatomize it. The Tendencies of thy Mind lie 
deeper far than any Thought, for they are the Conditions 
and the Laws of Thought; and it is these that thou must 
bring to Naught. 
This Way is most sure; most sacred; and the Enemies 
thereof most awful, most sublime. It is for the Great Souls 
to enter on this Rigour and Austerity; to Them the Gods 
themselves do Homage; for it is the Way of Utmost 
Purity. 
2 
DE VITA CORRIGENDA 
KNOW' Son, that the true Principle of Self-control is 
Liberty. For we are born into a World which is in 
Bondage to Ideals; to them we are perforce fitted, even 
as his Enemies to the Bed of Procrustes. Each of us, as 
he groweth, learns Repression of himself and his true 
Will, "It is a lie, this folly against self": these Words are 
written in the Book of the Law. So therefore those Pas-
sions in ourselves which we understand to be Hindrances 
are nor Art nor Part of our True Will, but diseased Ap-
petites, manifest in us through false early Training. Thus 
the Tabus of savage Tribes in such a matter as Love 
constrain that True Love which is born in us; and by 
this Constraint come Ills of Body and Mind. Either the 
Force of Repression carries it, and creates Neuroses and 
Insanities; or the Revolt against that Force, breaking 
forth with Violence, involves Excesses and Extravagan-
ces. All these Things are Disorders, and against Nature. 
Now then learn of me the Testimony of History and Lit-
erature, as a great Scroll of Learning. But the Vellum 
of the Scroll is of Man's Skin, and its Ink of his Heart's 
Blood. 
3 
LEGENDA DE AMORE 
THE Fault, that is Fatality, in Love, as in every other 
Form of Will, is Impurity. It is not the Spontaneity 
thereof which worketh Woe, but some Repression in the 
Environment. 
In the Fable of Adam and Eve is this great Lesson 
taught by the Masters of the Holy Qabalah. For Love 
were to them the eternal Eden, save for the Repression 
signified by the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. 
Thus their Nature of Love was perfect; it was their Fall 
from that Innocence which drove them from the Garden. 
In the Love of Romeo and Juliet was no Flaw; but fam-
ily Feud, which imported nothing to that Love, was its 
Bane; and the Rashness and Violence of their Revolt 
against that Repression, slew them. 
In the pure Outrush of natural Love in Desdemona for 
Othello was no Flaw; but his Love was marred by his 
Consciousness of his Age and of his Race, of the Preju-
dices of his Fellows and of his own Experience of 
Woman-frailty. 
4 
GESTA DE AMORE 
NOW as Literature overfloweth with the Murders of 
Love, so also doth History, and the Lesson is ever 
the same. 
Thus the Loves of Abelard and of Heloise were des-
troyed by the System of Repression in which they 
chanced to move. 
Thus Beatrice was robbed of Dante by social Artificial-
ities and Paolo slain on account of Things external to 
his Love for Francesca. 
Then, per contra, Martin Luther, being a Giant of Will, 
and also the Eighth Henry of England, as a mighty King, 
bent them to overturn the whole World that they might 
have satisfaction of their Loves. 
And who shall follow them? For even now we find 
great Churchmen, Statesmen, Princes, Dramamakers, and 
many lesser Men, overwhelmed utterly and ruined by 
the Conflict between their Passions and the Society about 
them. Wherein which Party errs is no matter of Moment 
for our Thought ; but the Existence of that War is Evi-
dence of Wrong done to Nature. 
5 
ULTIMA THESIS DE AMORE 
THEREFORE, o my Son, be thou wary, not bowing be-
fore the false Idols and Ideals, yet not flaming forth 
in Fury against them, unless that be thy Will. 
But in this Matter be prudent and be silent, discerning 
subtly and with Acumen the nature of the Will within 
thee ; so that thou mistake not Fear for Chastity, or An-
ger for Courage. And since the Fetters are old and heavy, 
and thy Limbs withered and distorted by reason of their 
Compulsion, do thou, having broken them, walk gently 
for a little while, until the ancient Elasticity return, so 
that thou mayst walk, run, and leap naturally and with 
Rejoicing. 
Also, since these Fetters are as a Bond almost univer-
sal, be instant to declare the Law of Liberty, and the full 
knowledge of all Truth that appertaineth to this Matter ; 
for if in this only thou overcome, then shall all Earth be 
free, taking its Pleasure in Sunlight without Fear or 
Phrenzy. Amen. 
6 
DE NATURA SUA PERCIPIENDA 
INDERSTAND, o my Son, in thy Youth, these Words 
which some wise One, now nameless spake of old: 
except ye become as little Children, ye shall in no wise 
enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. This is to say that 
thou must first comprehend thine original Nature in 
every Point, as it was before thou wast forced to bow 
before the Gods of Wood and Stone that Men have made, 
not comprehending the Law of Change, and of Evolution 
Through Variation, and the independent Value of every 
Living Soul. 
Learn this also, that even the Will to the Great Work 
may be misunderstood of Men ; for this Work must pro-
ceed naturally and without Overstress, as all true Works. 
Right also is that Word that the Kingdom of Heaven suf-
fereth Violence, and the violent take it by Force. But ex-
cept filial be violent by Virtue of thy true Nature, how 
shalt thou take it? Be not as the Ass in the Lion's Skin; 
but if thou be born Ass, bear patiently thy Burdens and 
enjoy thy Thistles; for an Ass also, as in the Fables of 
Apuleius and of Matthias, may come to glory in the Path 
of his own Virtue. 
7 
ALTERA DE VIA NATURAE. 
SAYEST thou (methinks) that here is a great Riddle, 
since by Reason of much Repression thou hast lost the 
Knowledge of thine original Nature? 
My Son, this is not so ; for by a peculiar Ordinance of 
Heaven, and a Disposition occult within his Mind, ig 
every man protected from this Loss of his own Soul, until 
and unless he be by Choronzon disintegrated and dis-
persed beyond power of Will to repair, as when the 
Conflict within him, rending and burning, hath made his 
Mind utterly Desert, and his Soul Madness. 
Give Ear, give Ear attentively; the Will is not lost, 
though it be buried beneath a life-old Midden of Repres-
sions ; for it persisteth vital within thee (is it not the true 
Motion of thine inmost Being ?) and for all thy conscious 
Striving, cometh forth by Night and by Stealth in Dream 
and Phantasy. Now is it naked and brilliant, now clothed 
in rich Robes of Symbol and Hieroglyph; but alway tray-
elleth it with thee upon thy Path, ready to acquaint thee 
with thy true Nature, if thou attend unto its Word, -  its 
Gesture, or its Show of Imagery. 
8 
QUO MODO NATURA SUA EST LFGENDA 
DEEM not therefore that thy lightest Fancy is witless : 
it is a Word to thee, a Prophecy, a Sign or Signal 
from thy Lord. Thy most unconscious Acts are Keys to 
the Treasure-Chamber of thine own Palace, which is the 
House of the Holy Ghost. Consider well thy conscious 
Thoughts and Acts, for they are under the Dominion of thy 
Will, and moved in Accord with the Operation of thy Rea-
son ; this indeed is a necessary Work, enabling thee to 
comprehend in what manner thou mayst adjust thyself 
to thine Environment. Yet is this Adaptation but Defence 
for the most Part, or at the best Subterfuge and Strata-
gem in the Tactics of thy Life, with but an accidental and 
subordinate Relation to thy true Will, whereof by Cons-
ciousness and by Reason thou mayst be ignorant, unless 
by Fortune great and rare thou be already harmonized 
in thyself, the Outer with the Inner, which Grace is not 
common among Men, and is the Reward of previous At-
tainment. 
Neglect not simple Introspection, therefore, but give 
yet greater heed unto those Dreams and Phantasies, those 
Gestures and Manners unconscious, and of undiscovered 
Cause, which betoken thee. 
9 
DE SOMNIIS a) Causa per Accidens 
AS all Diseases have two conjunct Causes, one imme- 
diate, external and exciting, the other constitutional, 
internal, and predisposing, so it is with Dreams, which 
are Dig-Eases, or unbalanced States, of Consciousness, 
Disturbers of Sleep as Thoughts are of Life. 
This exciting Cause is commonly of two kinds : vide-
licet, imprimis, the physical Conditon of the Sleeper, as 
a Dream of Water caused by a Shower without, or a 
Dream of Strangulation caused by a Dyspnoea, or a 
Dream of Lust caused by the seminal Congestions of an 
unclean Life, or a Dream of falling or flying caused by 
some unstable Equilibrium of his Body. 
Secundo, the psychical Condition of the Sleeper, the 
Dream being determined by recent Events in his Life, 
usually those of the Day previous, and especially such 
Events as have caused Excitement or Anxiety, the more 
so if they be unfinished or unfulfilled. 
But this exciting Cause is of a superficial Nature, as it 
were a Cloke or a Mask; and thus it but lendeth Aspect 
to the other Cause, which lieth in the Nature of the Sleep-
er himself. 
10 
DE SOMNIIS b) Causa per Naturam 
THE deep, constitutional, or predisposing Cause of 
Dreams Beth within the Jurisdiction of the Will itself. 
For that Will, being alway present, albeit (it may be) la-
tent, discovereth himself when no longer inhibited by 
that conscious Control which is determined by Environ-
ment, and therefore oft times contrary to himself. This 
being so, the Will declareth himself, as it were in a Pag-
eant, and sheweth himself thus apparelled, unto the 
Sleeper, for a Warning or Admonition. Every Dream, or 
Pageant of Fancy, is therefore a Shew of Will ; and Will 
being no more prevented by Environment or by Cons-
ciousness, cometh as a Conqueror. Yet even so he must 
come for the most Part throned upon the Chariot of the 
Exciting Cause of the Dream, and therefore is his Ap-
pearance symbolic, like a Writing in Cipher, or like a 
Fable, or like a Riddle in Pictures. But alway doth he 
triumph and fulfil himself therein, for the Dream is a 
natural Compensation in the inner World for any Failure 
of Achievement in the outer. 
11 
DE SOMNIIS c) Vestimenta horroris 
NOW then if in a Dream the Will be alway triumphant, 
how cometh it that a Man may be ridden of the 
Nightmare ? And of this the true Explanation is that in 
such a case the Will is in Danger, having been attacked 
and wounded, or corrupted by the Violence of some Re-
pression. Thus the Consciousness of the Will is directed 
to the sore Spot, as in Pain, and seeketh Comfort in an 
Externalization, or Shew, of that Antagonism. And be-
cause the Will is sacred, such Dreams excite an Ecstasy 
or Phrenzy of Horror, Fear, or Disgust. Thus the true 
Will of Oedipus was toward the Bed of Jocasta, but the 
Tabu, strong both by Inheritance and by Environment, 
was so attached to that Will that his Dream concerning 
his Destiny was a Dream of Fear and of Abhorrence, his 
Fulfilment thereof (even in Ignorance) a Spell to stir up 
all the subconscious Forces of all the People about him, 
and his Realization of the Act a Madness potent to drive 
him to self-inflicted Blindness and fury-haunted Exile. 
12 
DE SOMNIIS d) Sequentia 
KNOW firmly, o my Son, that the true Will cannot err; 
for it is thine appointed Course in Heaven, in whose 
Order is Perfection. 
A Dream of Horror is therefore the most serious of all 
Warnings ; for it signifieth that thy Will, which is Thy 
Self in respect of its Motion, is in Affliction and Danger. 
Thus thou must instantly seek out the Cause of that sub-
conscious Conflict, and destroy thine Enemy utterly by 
bringing thy conscious Vigour as an Ally to that true 
Will. If then there be a Traitor in that Consciousness, 
how much the more is it necessary for thee to arise and 
extirpate him before he wholly infect thee with the di-
vided Purpose which is the first Breach in that Fortress 
of the Soul whose Fall should bring it to that shapeless 
Ruin whose Name is Choronzon ! 
13 
DE SOMNIIS e) Clavicula 
THE Dream delightful is then a Pageant of the Fulfil- 
ment of the true Will and the Nightmare a symbolic 
Battle between it and its Assailants in thyself. But there 
can be only one true Will, even as there can be only one 
proper Motion in any Body, no Matter of how many Forces 
that Motion be the Resultant. Seek therefore this Will, 
and conjoin with it thy conscious Self ; for this is that 
which is written: "thou hast no right but to do thy will. 
Do that, and no other shall say nay." Thou seest, o my Son, 
that all conscious Opposition to thy Will, whether in Igno-
rance, or by Obstinacy, or through Fear of others, may in 
the End endanger even thy true Self, and bring thy Star 
into Disaster. 
And this is the true Key to Dreams • see that thou be 
diligent in its Use, and unlock therewith the secret 
Chambers of thine Heart. 
'14 
DE VIA PER EMPYRAEUM 
CONCERNING thy Travellings in the Body of Light, or 
Astral Journeys and Visions so-called, do thou lay this 
Wisdom to thine Heart, o my Son, that in this Practice, 
whether Things Seen and Heard be Truth and Reality, or 
whether they be Phantoms in the Mind, abideth this su-
preme Magical Value, namely : Whereas the Direction of 
such Journeys is consciously willed, and determined by 
Reason, and also unconsciously willed, by the true Self, 
since without It no Invocation were possible, we have here 
a Cooperation or Alliance between the Inner and the Outer 
Self, and thus an Accomplishment, at least partial, of the 
Great Work. 
And therefore is Confusion or Terror in any such Prac-
tice an Error fearful indeed, bringing about Obsession, 
which is a temporary or even it may be a permanent Di-
vision of the Personality, or Insanity, and therefore a De-
feat most fatal and pernicious, a Surrender of the Soul to 
Chnrnnz011. 
15 
DE CULTU 
NOW, o my Son, that thou mayst be well guarded against 
thy ghostly Enemies, do thou work constantly by the 
Means prescribed in our Holy Books. 
Neglect never the fourfold Adorations of the Sun in his 
four Stations, for thereby thou dost affirm thy Place in 
Nature and her Harmonies. 
Neglect not the Performance of the Ritual of the Pen-
tagram, and of the Assumption of the Form of Hoor-pa-
Kraat. 
Neglect not the daily Miracle of the Mass, either by 
the rite of the Gnostic Catholic Church, or that of the 
Phoenix. 
Neglect not the performance of the Mass of the Holy 
Ghost, as Nature Herself prompteth thee. 
Travel much also in the Empyrean in thy Body of Light, 
seeking ever Abodes more fiery and lucid. 
Finally, exercise constantly the Eight Limbs of Yoga. 
And so shalt thou come to the End 
16 
DE CLAVICULA SOMNIORUM 
AND now concerning Meditation let me disclose unto 
thee more fully the Mystery of the Key of Dreams and 
Phantasies. 
Learn first that as the thought of the Mind standeth 
before the Soul and hindereth its Manifestation in Con-
sciousness, so also the gross physical Will is the Creator 
of the Dreams of common Men. And as in Meditation 
thou dost destroy every Thought by mating it with its 
Opposite, so must thou cleanse thyself by a full and per-
fect Satisfaction of that bodily Will in the Way of Chas-
tity and Holiness which hath been revealed unto thee in 
thine Initiation. 
This inner Silence of the body being attained, it may 
be that the True Will may speak in True Dreams ; for it 
is written that He giveth unto His beloved in Sleep. 
Prepare thyself therefore in this Way, as a good Knight 
should de. 
17 
DE SOMNO LUCIDO 
Now know this also, that at the End of that secret Way 
lieth a Garden wherein is a Rest House prepared for 
thee. 
For to him whose physical Needs (of whatsoever kind) 
are not truly satisfied cometh a physical or lunar Sleep 
appointed to refresh and recreate by Cleansing and Re-
pose ; but on him that is bodily pure the Lord bestoweth 
a solar or lucid Sleep, wherein move Images of pure Light 
fashioned by the True Will. And this is called by the Qa-
balists the Sleep of Shiloam, and of this doth also Por-
phyry make mention, and Cicero, with many other Wise 
Men of Old Time. 
Compare, o my Son, with this Doctrine that which was 
taught thee in the Sanctuary of the Gnosis concerning the 
Death of the Righteous; and learn moreover that these 
are but particular Cases of an Universal Formula. 
18 
DE VENENIS 
MY Son, if thou fast awhile, there shall come unto thee 
a second State of physiological Being, in which is a 
Delight passive and equable, without Will, a Contentment 
of Weakness, with a Feeling of Lightness and of Purity. 
And this is because the Blood hath absorbed, in its Need 
of Nutriment, all foreign Elements. Such also is the Case 
with the Mind which hath not fed itself on Thought. Con-
sider the placid and ruminant Existence of such Persons 
as read little, are removed from worldly Struggle by some 
sufficient Property of small and unexciting Value, stably 
invested, and by Age and Environment are free from 
Passion. They live, according to their own Nature, without 
Desire, and they oppose no Resistance to the Operations 
of Time. Such are called happy; and in their Way of Veg-
etable Life it is so; for they are free of any Poison. 
19 
DE MOTU VITAE 
1" BARN then, o my Son, that all Phenomena are the Ef- 
fect of Conflict, even as the Universe itself is a Noth-
ing expressed as the Difference of two Equalities, or, 
an thou wilt, as the Divorce of Nuit and Hadit. So there-
fore every Marriage dissolveth a more material, and cre-
ateth a less material Complex; and this is our Way of 
Love, rising ever from Ecstasy to Ecstasy. So then all high 
Violence, that is to say, all Consciousness, is the spiritual 
Orgasm of a Passion between two lower and grosser 
Opposites. Thus Light and Heat result from the Mar ,  
riage of Hydrogen and Oxygen, Love from that of Man 
and Woman, Dhyana or Ecstasy from that of the Ego and 
the non-Ego. 
But be thou well grounded in this Thesis corollary, that 
one or two such Marriages do but destroy for a Time the 
Exacerbation of any Complex ; to deracinate such is a 
Work of long Habit and deep Search in Darkness for the 
Germ thereof. But this once accomplished, that particular 
Complex is destroyed, or sublimated, for ever. 
20 
DE MORBIS SANGUINIS 
NOW then understand that all Opposition to the Way of 
Nature createth Violence. If thine excretory System do 
its Function not at its fullest, there come Poisons in the 
Blood, and the Consciousness is modified by the Conflicts 
or Marriages between the Elements heterogeneous. Thus 
if the Liver be not efficient, we have Melancholy; if the 
Kidneys, Coma; if the Testes or Ovaries, loss of Personal-
ity itself. Also, an we poison the Blood directly with Bel-
ladonna, we have Delirium vehement and furious; with 
Hashish, Visions phantastic and enormous; with Anhalo-
nium, Ecstasy of Colour and what not ; with divers Germs 
of Disease, Disturbances of Consciousness varying with 
the Nature of the Germ. Also, with Ether, we gain the 
Power of analysing the Consciousness into its Planes and 
even of discovering the hidden Will and Judgment upon 
any Question ; and so for many others, 
But all these are, in our mystical Sense, Poisons ; that 
is, we take two Things diverse and opposite, binding them 
together so that they are compelled to unite; and the Or-
gasm of each Marriage is an Ecstasy, the lower dissolving 
in the higher. 
21 
DE CURSU AMORIS 
Icontinue then, o my Son, and reiterate that this Formula 
is general to all Nature. And thou wilt note that by re-
peated Marriage cometh Toleration, so that Ecstasy ap-
peareth no more. Thus his half grain of Morphia, which at 
first opened the Gates of Heaven, is nothing worth to the 
Self-poisoner after a Year of daily Practice. So too the 
Lover findeth no more Joy in Union with his Mistress, so 
soon as the original Attraction between them is satisfied 
by repeated Conjunctions. For this Attraction is an Anta-
gonism ; and the greater the Antinomy, the more fierce 
the Puissance of the Magnetism, and the Quantity of 
Energy disengaged by the Coition. Thus in the Union of 
Similars, as of Halogens with each other, is no strong 
Passion or explosive Force ; and the Love between two 
Persons of like Character and Taste is placid and without 
Transmutation to higher Planes. 
22 
DE NUPTIIS MYSTICIS 
omy Son, how wonderful is the Wisdom of this Law of 
Love ! How vast are the Oceans of uncharted Joy that 
lie before the Keel of thy Ship ! Yet know this, that every 
Opposition is in its Nature named Sorrow, and the Joy 
lieth in the Destruction of the Dyad. Therefore, must thou 
seek ever those Things which are to thee poisonous, and 
that in the highest Degree, and make them thine by Love. 
That which repels, that which disgusts, must thou assimi-
late in this Way of Wholeness. Yet rest not in the Joy of 
the Destruction of every Complex in thy Nature, but 
press on to that ultimate Marriage with the Universe 
whose Consummation shall destroy thee utterly, leaving 
only that Nothingness which was before the Beginning. 
So then the Life of Non-action is not for thee ; the 
Withdrawal from Activity is not the Way of the Tao; but 
rather the Intensification and making universal of every 
Unit of thine Energy on every Plane. 
23 
DE VOLTJPTATE POENARUM 
(10 forth, o my Son, o Son of the Sun, rejoicing in thy 
Strength, as a Warrior, as a Bridegroom, to take thy 
Pleasure upon the Earth, and in every Palace of the Mind, 
moving ever from the crass to the subtle, from the coarse 
to the fine. Conquer every Repulsion in thy Self, subdue 
every Aversion. Assimilate all Poison, for therein only is 
there Profit. Seek constantly therefore to know what is 
painful and to cleave thereunto, for by Pain cometh true 
Pleasure. Those who avoid Pain physical or mental remain 
little Men, and there is no Virtue in them. Yet be thou 
ware lest thou fall into that Heresy which maketh Pain 
and Self-sacrifice as it were Bribes to a corrupt God, to 
secure some future Pleasure in an imagined After-life. 
Nay, also, of the other Part, fear not to destroy thy Com-
plexes, thinking dreadfully thereby to lose the Power of 
creating Joy by their Distinction. Yet in each Marriage 
be thou bold to affirm the spiritual Ardour of the Orgasm, 
fixing it in some Talisman, whether it be Art, or Magick, 
or Thetuty. 
24 
DE VOLUNTATE ULTIMA 
SAY not then that this Way is contrary to Nature, and 
that in Simplicity of Satisfaction of thy Needs is Per-
fection of thy Path. For to thee, who Ilast aspired, it is 
thy Nature to perform the Great Work, and this is the 
final Dissolution of the Cosmos. For though a Stone seem 
to lie still upon a Mountain Top, and have no Care, yet 
hath it an hidden Nature, a Task Ineffable and Stupen-
dous; namely, to force its Way to the Centre of Gravity of 
the Universe, and also to burn up its Elements into the 
final Homogeneity of Matter. Therefore the Way of Quiet 
is but an Illusion of Ignorance. Whoever thou mayst be 
now, thy Destiny is that which I have declared unto thee; 
and thou art most fixed in the True Way when, accepting 
this consciously as thy Will, thou gatherest up thy Powers 
to move thy Self mightily within it. 
25 
DE DIFFERENTIA RERUM 
BUT' o my Son although thine ultimate Nature be Uni- 
versal, thine immediate Nature is Particular. Thy 
Way to the Centre is not oriented as that of any other 
Being, and thine Elements are not kin, but alien, to his. 
For Shame ! is it not the most transcendent of all the 
Wisdoms of this Cosmos, that no two Beings are alike? 
Lo! this is the Secret of all Beauty, and maketh Love not 
only possible, but necessary, between every Thing and 
every other Thing. So then, lest thou in thine Ignorance 
take some false Way, and divagate, must thou learn thine 
own particular and peculiar Nature in its Relation to all 
others. For though it be Illusion, it is by the true Analysis 
of Falsehoods that we are able to destroy them, just as 
the Physician must understand the Disease of his Patient 
if he is to choose the fitting Remedy. Now therefore will 
I make yet more clear unto thee the Value of thy Dreams 
and Phantasies and Gestures of thine unconscious Body 
and Mind, as Symptoms of thy particular Will, and shew 
thee how thou mayst come to their Interpretation. 
26 
DE VOLUNTATE TACITA 
ALL Disturbances, o my Son, are Variations from Equi- 
librium; and just as thy conscious Thoughts, Words, 
and Acts are Effects of the Displacement of the conscious 
Will, so is it in the Unconscious. For the most Part, there-
fore, all Dreams, Phantasies, and Gestures represent 
that WiE subliminal ; and if the physical Part of that 
Will be unsatisfied, its Utterance will predominate in all 
these automatic Expressions. Do thou then note what Mo-
difications thereof follow such Changes in the conscious 
Foundation of that part of thy Will as thou mayst make 
in thine Experiments therewith, and thus separate, as 
sayeth Trismegistus, the fine from the coarse, Fire from 
Earth, or, as we may say, assign each Effect to its true 
Cause. Seek then to perfect a conscious Satisfaction of 
every Part of this Will, so that the unconscious Disturb-
ances be at last brought to Silence. Then will the Resi-
duum be as it were an Elixir clarified and perfected, a 
true Symbol of that other hidden Will which is the Vector 
of thy Magical Self. 
27 
DE FORMULA SUMMA 
LEARN moreover that thy Self includeth the whole Uni- 
verse of thy Knowledge, so that every Increase upon 
every Plane is an Aggrandisement of that Self. Yet the 
greater part of this Universe is common Knowledge, so 
that thy Self is interwover. with other Selves, save for 
that Part peculiar to thy Self. And as thou growest, so 
also this peculiar Part is ever of less Proportion to the 
whole, until when thou becomest infinite, it is a Quantity 
infinitesimal and to be neglected. Lo ! when the All is ab-
sorbed within the I, it is as if the I were s bsorbed within 
the All ; for if two Things become wholly and indissolubly 
One Thing, there is no more Reason for Names, since 
Names are given to mark off one Thing from another. And 
this is that which is written in the Book of the Law: Let 
there be no difference made among you between any one 
thing & any other thing; for thereby there cometh 
hurt. But whoso availeth in this, let him be the chief of all! 
28 
DE VIA INERTIAE 
11F the Way of the Tao I have already written to thee, o 
my Son, but I must further instruct thee in this Doc-
trine of doing everything by doing nothing. I will first 
have thee to understand that the Universe being as above 
said an Expression of Zero under the figure of the Dyad, 
its Tendency is continually to release itself from that 
Strain by the Marriage of Opposites whenever they are 
brought into Contact. Thus thy true Nature is a Will to 
Zero, or en Inertia, or Doing Nothing; and the Way of 
Doing Nothing is to oppose no Obstacle to the free Func-
tion of that true Nature. Consider the Electrical Charge 
of a Cloud, whose Will is to discharge itself in Earth, 
and so to release the strain of its Potential. Do this by 
free Conduction, there is Silence and Darkness; oppose it, 
there is Heat and Light, and the Rending asunder of that 
which will not permit free Passage to the Current. 
29 
DE VIA LIBERTATIS 
DO not think then that by Non-action thou dost follow 
the Way of the Tao, for thy Nature is Action, and by 
hindering the Discharge of thy Potential thou dost per-
petuate and aggravate the Stress. If thou ease not Na- • 
ture, she will bring thee to Dis-ease. Free therefore every 
Function of thy Body and of every other Part of thee ac-
cording to its true Will. This also is most necessary, that 
thou discover that true Will in every case, for thou art 
born into Dis-ease, where are many false and perverted 
Wills, monstrous Growths, Parasites, Vermin are they, 
adherent to thee by Vice of Heredity or of Environment 
or of evil Training. And of all these Things the subtlest 
and most terrible, Enemies without pity, destructive to 
thy Will, and a Menace and Tyranny even to thy Self, 
are the Ideals and Standards of the Slave-gods, false 
Religion, false Ethics, even false Science. 
30 
DE LEGE MOTUS 
CONSIDER, my Son, that word in the Call or Key of the 
Thirty Aethyrs : Behold the Face of your God, the 
Beginning of Comfort, whose eyes are the Brightness of 
the Heavens, which provided you for the Government of 
the Earth, and her Unspeakable Variety ! And again: let 
there be no Creature upon her or within her the same. 
All her Members let them differ in their Qualities, and 
let there be no Creature equal with another. Here also 
is the voice of true Science, crying aloud: Variation is 
the Key of Evolution. Thereunto Art cometh the third, 
perceiving Beauty in the Harmony of the Diverse. Know 
then, o my Son, that all Laws, all Systems, all Customs, 
all Ideals and Standards which tend to produce Uniform-
ity, being in direct Opposition to Nature's Will to 
change and to develop through Variety, are accursed. Do 
thou with all thy Might of Manhood strive against these 
Forces, for they resist Change, which is Life; and thus 
they are of Death. 
31 
DE LEGIBUS CONTRA MOTUM 
SAY not, in thine Haste, that such Stagnations are Unity 
even as the last Victory of thy free Will is Unity. For 
thy Will moveth through free Function, according to its 
particular Nature, to that End of Dissolution of all Com-
plexities, and the Ideals and Standards are Attempts to 
halt thee on that Way. Although for thee some certain 
Ideal be upon thy Path, yet for thy Neighbour it 
may not be so. Set all Men a-horseback ; thou speedest 
the Foot-soldier upon his way, indeed; but what hast 
thou done to the Bird-man ? Thou must have simple Laws 
and Customs to express the general Will, and so prevent 
the Tyranny or Violence of a few ; but multiply them not ! 
Now then herewith I will declare unto thee the Limits 
of the Civil Law upon the Rock of the Law of Thelema. 
32 
DE NECESSITATE COMMUNE 
UNDERSTAND first that the Disturbers of the Peace of 
Mankind do so by Reason of their Ignorance of their 
own True Wills. Therefore, as this Wisdom of mine in-
creaseth among Mankind, the false Will to Crime must 
become constantly more rare. Also, the Exercise of Our 
Freedom will cause Men to be born with less and ever 
less Affliction from that Dis-ease of Spirit, which breed-
eth these false Wills. But, in the While of waiting for 
this Perfection, thou must by Law assure to every Man 
a Means of satisfying his bodily and his mental Needs, 
leaving him free to develop any Superstructure in accord-
ance with his Will, and protecting him from any that 
may seek to deprive him of these vertebral Rights. There 
shall be therefore a Standard of Satisfaction, though it 
must vary in Detail with Race, Climate, and other such 
Conditions. And this Standard shall be based upon a large 
Interpretation of Facts biological, physiological, and the 
like. 
33 
DE LIBERTATE CORPORIS 
THERE shall be no Property in human Flesh. Every 
Man and every Woman hath Right Indefeasable to 
give the Body for the Enjoyment of any other. The Exer-
cise of that Right shall not be punished either by Law or 
by Custom ; there shall be no Penalty either by Loss or 
Curtailment of Liberty, of Rights, of Wealth, or of social 
Esteem ; but this Freedom shall be respected of all, seeing 
that it is the Right of the bodily Will. For this same 
Reason thou shalt cause full Restriction and Punishment 
of any who may seek to limit that Freedom for the sake 
of his own Profit, or Desire, or Ideal. Every Man and 
every Woman hath full right either to grant or to deny 
the Body, as the Will speaketh within. This being made 
Custom, the evils of Love, which are many, extending 
to the Disturbance not only of Body but of Mind, and 
that in obscure Paths, shall little by little disappear 
from the Face of His unspeakable Glory. 
34 
DE LIBERTATE MENTIS 
THERE shall be no Property in Human Thought. Let 
each think as he will concerning the Universe; but let 
none seek to impose that Thought upon another by any 
Threat of Penalty in this World or any other World. Look 
now, though I enkindle thee to Effort in thy Way, yet it 
is the Way of thy Will, and I say not even that thou dost 
well to haste therein, for the whole Matter lieth in thy 
Will, and to force thyself against thy Nature would be 
an Obstacle to thy Passage. But if I urge thee to run well 
this Race as an Athlete, it is because I have perceived in 
thy Nature that fierce Lust and mighty Concentration in 
that Will, and I write this Letter unto thee knowing well 
that thou wilt rejoice exceedingly therein, since it is an 
Expression of thine own Will, and it may be a Discovery 
thereof, which Thing thou vehemently seekest I charge 
thee therefore that thou permit none to tyrannize any 
other in Thought, or to threaten, or in any other wise to 
blaspheme the great Liberty of Our Father the Sun in 
the Great Cosmos, or of His Viceregent in the Little. 
35 
DE LIBERTATE JUVENUM 
n thou that art the Child of mine own Bowels, how shall 
I write to thee concerning Children? For herein is 
the Gordian Knot in our whole Rope of Wisdom, and it 
may not be severed by Sword, no, not of a greater than 
Alexander the Two-Horned. And it is a Balance like that 
of the Egg, and the violence of a Columbus will but 
crack the tender Shell which we must first of all preserve. 
Now Sentinel to this Fortress standeth a certain Par-
adox of general Application and in this large Order I 
will declare it, so that its particular Sense may enlighten 
thy Mind hereafter. And this is the Paradox, that there 
are Bonds which lead to Slavery, and Bonds which lead 
to Freedom. All we are bound in many Fetters by Envi-
ronment, and it is for ourselves in great Part to determine 
whether they shall enslave us or emancipate us. And I 
will make clear this Thesis to thee by the Way of Illus-
tration. 
36 
DE VI PER DISCIPLINAM COLENDA 
CONSIDER the Bond of a cold Climate, how it maketh 
man a Slave: he must have Shelter and Food with 
fierce Toil. Yet thereby he becometh strong against the 
Elements, and his moral Force waxeth, so that he is 
Master of such Men as live in Lands of Sun where bodily 
Needs are satisfied without Struggle. 
Consider also him that willeth to excel in Speed or in 
Battle, how he denieth himself the Food he craveth, and 
all Pleasures natural to him, putting himself under the 
harsh Order of a Trainer. So by this Bondage he hath, at 
the last, his Will. 
Now then the one by natural, and the other by volun-
tary, Restriction have come each to a greater Liberty. 
This is also a general law of Biology, for all Development 
is Structuralization ; that is, a Limitation and Speciali-
zation of an originally indeterminate Protoplasm, which 
latter may therefore be called free, in the definition of a 
Pedant. 
37 
DE ORDINE VERUM 
IN the Body every Cell is subordinated to the general 
physiological Control, and we who will that Control 
do not ask whether each individual Unit of that Structure 
be consciously happy. But we do care that each shall 
fulfil its Function, and the Failure of even a few Cells, 
or their Revolt, may involve the Death of the whole Or-
ganism. Yet even here the Complaint of a few, which 
we call Pain, is a Warning of general Danger. Many Cells 
fulfil their Destiny by swift Death, and this being their 
Function, they in no wise resent it. Should Haemoglobin 
resist the Attack of Oxygen, the Body would perish, and 
the Haemoglobin would not thereby save itself. Now, o 
my Son, do then consider deeply of these Things in thine 
Ordering of the World under the Law of Thelema. For 
every Individual in the State must be perfect in his own 
Function, with Contentment, respecting his own Task as 
necessary and holy, not envious of another's. For so only 
mayst thou build up a Free State, whose directing Will 
shall be singly directed to the Welfare of all. 
38 
DE FUNDAMENTIS CIVITATIS 
SAY not, o my Son, that in this Argument I have set 
Limits to individual Freedom. For each Man in this 
State which I purpose is fulfilling his own true Will by 
his eager Acquiescence in the Order necessary to the 
Welfare of all, and therefore of himself also. But see thou 
well to it that thou set high the Standard of Satisfaction, 
and that to every one be a surplus of Leisure and of Ener-
gy, so that, his Will of Self-preservation being fulfilled 
by the Performance of his Function in the State, he may 
devote the Remainder of his Powers to the Satisfaction of 
the other Parts of his Will. And because the People are 
oft-times unlearned, not understanding Pleasure, let them 
be instructed in the Art of Life: to prepare Food palat-
able and wholesome, each to his own Taste, to make 
Clothes according to Fancy, with Variety of Individuality, 
and to practice the manifold Crafts of Love These Things 
being first secured, thou mayst afterward lead them into 
the Heavens of Poesy and Tale, of Music, Painting, and 
Sculpture, and into the Lore of the Mind itself, with its 
insatiable Joy of all Knowledge. Thence let them soar! 
39 
DE VOLITNTATE JUVENUM 
LONG, o my Son, hath been this Digression from the 
plain Path of my Word concerning Children; but it 
was most needful that thou shouldst understand the Lim-
its of true Liberty. For that is not the Will of any Man 
which ultimateth in his own Ruin and that of all his Fel-
lows; and that is not Liberty whose Exercise bringeth 
him to Bondage. Thou mayst therefore assume that it is 
elway an essential Part of the Will of any Child to grow 
to Manhood or to Womanhood in Health, and his Guard-
ians may therefore prevent him from ignorantly acting 
in Opposition thereunto, Care being always taken to re-
move the Cause of the Error, namely, Ignorance, as afore-
said. Thou mayst also assume that it is Part of the 
Child's Will to train every Function of the Mind; and the 
Guardians may therefore combat the Inertia which hin-
ders its Development. Yet here is much Caution neces-
sary, and it is better to work by exciting and satisfying 
any natural Curiosity than by forcing Application to set 
Tasks, however obvious this Necessity may appear. 
40 
DE MODO DISPUTANDI 
NOW in this Training of the Child is one most dear Con- 
sideration, that I shall impress upon thee as in Con-
formity with our holy Experience in the Way of Truth. 
And it is this, that since that which can be thought is not 
true, every Statement is in some sense false. Even 
on the Sea of pure Reason, we may say that every State-
ment is in some Sense disputable. Therefore in every Case, 
even the simplest, the Child should be taught not only the 
Thesis, but also its opposite, leaving the Decision to the 
child's own Judgment and good Sense, fortified by Expe-
rience. And this Practice will develop its Power of 
Thought, and its Confidence in itself, and its Interest in 
all Knowledge. But most of all be ware against any At-
tempt to bias its Mind on any Point that lieth without the 
Square of ascertained and undisputed Fact. Remember 
also, even when thou art most sure, that so were they 
sure who gave Instruction to the young Copernicus. Pay 
Reverence also to the Unknown unto whom thou presum-
est to impart thy Knowledge; for he may be one greater 
than thou. 
41 
DE VOLUNTATE JUVENIS COGNOSCENDA 
IT is important that thou shouldst understand as early 
as may be what is the true Will of the Child in the Mat-
ter of his Career. Be thou well ware of all Ideals and Day-
dreams; for the Child is himself, and not thy Toy. Recall 
the comic Tragedy of Napoleon and the King of Rome; 
build not an House for a wild Goat, nor plant a Forest for 
the Domain of a Shark. But be thou vigilant for every 
Sign, conscious or unconscious, of the Will of the Child, 
giving him then all Opportunity to pursue the Path which 
he thus indicates. Learn this, that he, being young, will 
weary quickly of all false Ways, however pleasant they 
may be to him at the Outset; but of the true Way he will 
not weary. This being in this Manner discovered, thou 
mayst prepare it for him perfectly; for no man can keep 
all Roads open for ever. And to him making his Choice, 
explain how one may not travel far on any one Road 
without a general Knowledge of Things apparently irrel-
evant. And with that he will understand, and bend him 
wisely to his Work. 
42 
DE AURO RUBE° 
IWOULD have thee to consider, o my Son, that Word of 
Publius Vergilius Maro, that was the greatest of all the 
Magicians of his Time: in medio tutissimus ibis. Which 
Thing hath also been said by many wise Men in other 
Lands; and the holy Qabalah confirmeth the same, plac-
ing Tiphereth, which is the Man, and the Beauty and Har-
mony of Things, and Gold in the Kingdom of the Metals, 
and the Sun among the Planets, in the Midst of the Tree of 
Life For the Centre is the Point of Balance of all Vectors. 
So then if thouwilt live wisely, learn that thou must esta-
blish this Relation of Balance with every Thing scever, 
not omitting one. For there is nothing so alien from thy 
Nature that it may not be brought into harmonious Re-
lation therewith; and thy Stature of Manhood waxeth 
great even as thou comest to the Perfection of this Art. 
And there is nothing so close Kin to thee that it may not 
be hurtful to thee if this Balance be not truly adjusted. 
Thou hast need of the whole Force of the Universe to 
work with thy Will; but this Force must be disposed 
about the Shaft of that Will so that there is no tendency 
to Hindrance or to Deflection. And in my Love of thee I 
will adorn this Thesis with Example following. 
43 
DE SAPIENTIA IN RE SEXUALI 
CONSIDER Love. Here is a Force destructive and cor- 
rupting whereby have many Men been lost: witness 
all History. Yet without Love Man were not Man. There-
fore thine Uncle Richard Wagner made of our Doctrine a 
Musical Fable, wherein we see Amfortas, who yielded 
himself to Seduction, wounded beyond Healing; Klingsor, 
who withdrew himself from a like Danger, cast out for 
ever from the Mountain of Salvation; and Parsifal, who 
yielded not, able to exercise the true Power of Love, and 
thereby to perform the Miracle of Redemption. Of this 
also have I myself written in my Poema called Adonis. It 
is the same with Food and Drink, with Exercise, with 
Learning itself; the Problem is ever to bring the Appetite 
into the right Relation with the Will. Thus thou mayst 
fast or feast; there is no Rule, but that of Balance, And 
this Doctrine is of general Acceptation among the better 
sort of Men; therefore on thee will I rather impress more 
carefully the other Part of my Wisdom, namely, the 
Necessity of extending constantly thy Nature to new 
Mates upon every plane of Being, so that thou mayst 
become the perfect Microcosm, an Image without Flaw 
of all that is. 
44 
DE GRADIBUS AEQUIS SCIENTIAE 
I SAY in Sooth, o my Son, that this Extension of thy 
Nature is not in Violation thereof; for it is the Nature 
of thy Nature to grow continually. Now there is no part of 
Knowledge which is foreign to thee; yet Knowledge itself 
is of no avail unless it be assimilated and co-ordinated into 
Understanding. Grow therefore easily and spontaneously, 
developing all Parts equally, lest thou become a Monster. 
And if one Thing tempt thee overmuch, correct it by 
Devotion to its Opposite until Equilibrium be re-establish-
ed. But seek not to grow by sudden Determination toward 
Things that be far from thee; only, if such a Thing come 
into thy Thought, construct a Bridge thereunto, and take 
firmly the first Step upon that Bridge I shall explain 
this. Dost thou speculate upon the Motives of the Stars, 
and on their Elements, their Size and Weight? Then 
thou must first gain Knowledge of Things mathematical, 
of Laws physical and chemical. So then first, that thou 
mayst understand clearly the Nature of thine whole Work, 
map out thy Mind, and extend its Powers from the 
essential outwards, from the near to the far, always with 
Firmness and great Thoroughness, making every Link in 
thy Chain equal and perfect. 
45 
DE VIRTUTE AUDENDI 
VET this I charge thee with my Might: Live Dangerous- 
ly. Was not this the Word of thine Uncle Friedrich 
Nietzsche? Thy meanest Foe is the Inertia of the Mind. 
Men do hate most those Things which touch them closely, 
and they fear Light, and persecute the Torchbearers. Do 
thou therefore analyse most fully all those Ideas which 
Men avoid; for the Truth shall dissolve Fear. Rightly in-
deed Men say that the Unknown is terrible; but wrongly 
do they fear lest it become the Known. Moreover, do thou 
all Acts of which the Common Sort beware, save where 
thou hast already full Knowledge, that thou mayst learn 
Use and Control, not falling into Abuse and Slavery. For 
the Coward and the Foolhardy shall not live out their 
Days. Every Thing bath his right Use; and thou art 
great as thou hast Use of Things. This is the Mystery 
of all Art Magick, and thine Hold upon the Universe. Yet 
if thou must err, being human, err by excess of Courage 
rather than of Caution; for it is the Foundation of the 
Honour of Man that he dareth greatly. What saith Quintus 
Horatius Flaccus in the third Ode of his First Book? Die 
thou standing! 
46 
DE ARTE MENTIS COLENDI a) Mathematica 
N°W concerning the first Foundation of thy Mind I will 
say somewhat. Thou shalt study with Diligence in the 
Mathematics, because thereby shall be revealed unto 
thee the Laws of thine own Reason and the Limitatiiins 
thereof. This Science manifesteth unto thee thy true 
Nature in respect of the Machinery whereby it worketh, 
and showeth in pure Nakedness, without Clothing of 
Personality or Desire the Anatomy of thy conscious Self. 
Furthermore, by this thou mayst understand the Essence 
of the Relations between all Things, and the Nature of 
Necessity, and come to the Knowledge of Form. For this 
Mathematics is as it were the last Veil before the Image 
of Truth, so that there is no Way better than our Holy 
Qabalah, which analyseth all Things soever, and reduceth 
them to pure Number; and thus their Natures being no 
longer coloured and confused, they may be regulated 
and formulated in Simplicity by the Operation a Pure 
Reason, to thy great Comfort in the Work of our Tran-
scendental Art, whereby the Many become One. 
47 
SEQUITUR b) Classics 
MY son, neglect not in any wise the study of the Writings 
of Antiquity, and that in the original Language. For 
by this thou shalt discover the History of the Structure of 
thy Mind, that is, its Nature regarded as the last Term 
in a Sequence of Causes and Effects. For thy Mind hath 
been built up of these Elements, so that in these Books 
thou mayst bring into the Light thine own subconscious 
Memories. And thy Memory is as it were the Mortar in 
the House of thy Mind, without which is no Cohesion or 
Individuality possible, so that it is called Dementia. And 
these Books have lived long and become famous because 
they are the Fruits of ancient Trees whereof thou art 
directly the Heir, wherefore (say I) they are more truly 
german to thine own Nature than Books of Collateral 
Offshoots, though such were in themselves better and 
wiser. Yea, o my son, in these Writings thou mayst study 
to come to the true Comprehension of thine own Nature, 
and that of the whole Universe, in the dimension of Time, 
even as the Mathematic declareth it in that of Space: 
that is, of Extension. Moreover, by this Study shall the 
Child comprehend the Foundation of Manners: the which, 
as sayeth one of the Sons of Wisdom, maketh Man. 
48 
SEQUITUR c) Scientifica 
SINCE Time and Space are the conditions of Mind, these 
two Studies are fundamental. Yet there remaineth 
Causality, which is the Root of the Actions and Reactions 
of Nature. This also shalt thou seek ardently, that thou 
mayest comprehend the Variety of the Universe, its Har-
mony and its Beauty, with the Knowledge of that which 
compelleth it. Yet this is not equal to the former two in 
Power to reveal thee to thyself; and its first Use is to 
instruct thee in the true Method of Advancement in 
Knowledge, which is, fundamentally, the Observation of 
the Like and the Unlike. Also, it shall arouse in thee the 
Ecstasy of Wonder ; and it shall bring thee to a proper 
Understanding of Art Magick. For cur Magick is but one 
of the Powers that lie within us undeveloped and unana-
lysed; and it is by the Method of Science that it must be 
made clear, and available to the Use of Man. Is not this 
a Gift beyond Price, the Fruit of a Tree not only of 
Knowledge but of Life? For there is that in Man which is 
God, and there is that also which is Dust; and by our 
Magick we shall make these twain one Flesh, to the Ob-
taining of the Empery of the Universe. 
49 
DE MODO QUO OPERET LEX MAGICA 
GIVE ear attentively, o my Son, while I expound unto 
thee the true Doctrine of Magick. Every Force acteth, 
in due Proportion, on all Things with which it is connected. 
Thus a burning Forest causeth chemical Change by Com-
bustion and giveth Heat and Motion to the Air about it by 
the Operation of physical Laws, and exciteth Thought and 
Emotion in the Man whom it reacheth through his Organs 
of Perception. Consider (even though it were but Legend) 
the Fall of the Apple of Isaac Newton, its Effect upon the 
Spiritual Destinies of Man ! Consider also that no Force 
cometh ever to the End of its Work; the Air that is moved 
by my Breath is a Disturbance or Change of Equilibrium 
that cannot be fully compensated and brought to naught, 
though the Aeons be endless. Who then shall deny the 
Possibility of Magick? Well said Frazer, the most learned 
Doctor of the College of the Holy Trinity in the University 
of Cambridge, that Science was but the Name of Magick 
which failed not of its intended Effect. 
50 
DE MACHINA MAGICA 
LO! I put forth my Will, and my Pen moveth upon the 
Paper, by cause that my Will mysteriously hath Power 
upon the Muscles of my Arm, and these do work at a 
mechanical Advantage against the Inertia of the Pen. 
I cannot break down the Wall opposite me, by cause that 
I cannot come into mechanical Relation with it; or the Wall 
at my side, by cause that I am not strong enough to over-
come its Inertia. To win that Battle I must call Time and 
Pick-axe to mine Aid. But how could I retard the Motion 
of the Earth in Space? I am myself Party of its Momentum. 
Yet every stroke of my Pen affecteth that Motion 
by changing the Equilibrium thereof. The Problem of eve-
ry Act of Magick is then this: to exert a Will, sufficiently 
powerful to cause the required Effect,through a Menstruum 
or Medium of Communication. By the common Under-
standing of the word Magick, we yet exclude such Media 
as are generally known and understood. Now then, o my 
Son, will I declare unto thee first the Nature of the Power, 
and afterward that of the Medium. 
51 
DE HARMONIA ANIMAE CUM CORPORE 
ALL Things are interwoven. The most spiritual Thought 
in thy Soul (I speak as a Fool) is also a most material 
Change in Blood or Brain. Anger maketh the blood acid; 
Hate poisoneth Mother's Milk; even as I shewed formerly 
in reverse, how Disturbance of physical Function altereth 
the states of Consciousness. Now no Man doubteth the• 
Power of the Will of Man, whether it be his Love that 
begetteth Children or causeth Wars wherein many Men 
be slain, whether it be his Eloquence that moveth a Mob, 
or his Vanity that destroyeth a People. Only in all such 
Cases we understand how Nature worketh, through known 
Laws physical or psychical. That is, there is a State of 
unstable Equilibrium, so that one Machine setteth another 
in Motion as soon as the first Disturbance ariseth. There-
fore, it is not proper to regard all Consequence of a Will 
as its Effect. Without the Revolution there could have been 
no great Effect of the Will of Napoleon; and moreover 
his Will was broken in the End, to the present Misfortune 
(as it seemeth to many besides myself) of Mankind. This 
Magick, therefore, dependeth greatly on the Art to set 
many other Wills in sympathetic Motion; and the greatest 
Magus may not be the most successful— in a mean Con-
ception of a Limit of Time. He may need many Blows 
before he breaketh down his Wall, if that be strong, 
while a Child may push over one that is ready to crumble. 
52 
DE MYSTERIO PRUDENTIAE 
BEHOLD now Nature, how prodigal is She of her Forces! 
The evident Will of every Acorn is to become an Oak; 
yet nigh all fail of that Will. Therefore one Secret of Magick 
is CEconomy of thy Force; to do no Act unless secure of 
its Effect. And if every Act hath an Effect on every Plane, 
how canst thou do this unless thou be connected with 
all Planes? For this reason must thou know thoroughly 
not only thy Body and thy Mind, but thy Body of Light 
and all its subtler Principles soever. But I will have thee 
to consider most especially what Powers thou hast within 
thee which are certainly capable of great Effects, yet which 
are constantly wasted. Think then whether if these 
Powers, frustrate of their End upon one Plane, might not 
be turned to high Purpose and assured Success upon 
another. For an hundred Acorns, rightly set in Condi-
tions fit for their true Growth, will become an hundred 
Oaks, while otherwise they make but one Meal for one 
Hog, and their subtile Nature is wholly lost to them. Learn 
then, o my Son, this mystery of (Economy and apply it 
faithfully and with Diligence in thy Work. 
53 
DE ARTE ALCHEMICA 
HERE then must I write concerning Talismans for thine 
Instruction. Know first that there are certain Vehicles 
proper for the Incarnation of the Will. I instance Paper, 
whereon by thine Art thou writest a symbolic Representa-
tion of thy Will, so that when thou next seest it, thou art 
reminded of that Will, or it may be that another, seeing it, 
is moved to obey that Will. Here then is a case of Incarna-
tion and Assumption, which, before it was understood, was 
rightly considered Gramarye or Magick. Again, thy Will 
to live causeth thee to plant Corn, which in due Season be-
ing eaten is again transmuted into Will. Thus thou mayst 
in many Ways impress any particular Will upon the prop-
er Substance, so that by due Use thou comest at last to its 
Accomplishment. So general is this Formula, in Truth, that 
all conscious Actions may be included within its Scope. 
There is also the converse, as when external Objects create 
Appetite, whose Satisfaction again reacteth upon the 
physical Plane. Praise thou the Wonder of the Mystery of 
Nature, rising and falling with every Breath, so that there 
is no Part which is not mystically Partaker of the Whole. 
54 
DE ARCANO SUBTILISSIMO 
0 MY son, there is that within thee of marvellous Puis- 
sance which is by its own Nature the Incarnation of thy 
Will, most ready to receive the Seal thereof. Therein 
lie hidden all Powers, all Memories, more than thou hast 
thyself ten thousandfold! Learn then to draw from that 
great Treasure-House the Jewel of which thou art in any 
present Need. For all Things that are possible to thy 
Nature are already hidden within thee; and thou hast but 
to name them, and to bring them back into the Light of 
thy Consciousness. Then squander not this Gold of thine, 
but put it to most fruitful Usury. Now then of the Art and 
Craft of this most holy Mystery I write not, for a Reason 
that thou already knowest. Moreover, in this Matter thou 
shalt best learn by thine own Experience, and thine Obser-
vation in true Science shall guide thee. For this Secret is 
still of Magick, and occult, so that I know not certainly if 
thy Will lieth my Way or no. 
55 
DE MENSTRUO ARTIS 
BUT concerning the Medium by whose sensitive Nature 
our Magick Force is transmitted to the Object of our 
Working, doubt not. For already in other Galaxies of 
Physics have some been compelled to postulate an Athyr 
wholly hypothetical in order to explain the Phenomena of 
Light, Electricity, and the like; nor doth any man demand 
Demonstration of the Existence of that 2Ethyr other than 
its Conformity with general Law. Thou therefore Creator 
and Transmittor of thine own Energy, needest not to ask 
whether by this or by some other Means thou performest 
thy Work. Yet I know not why this Athyr which the 
Mathematicians al I the Physicists imagined, yet were 
not able to •efine, its Nature being beyond Reason, should 
not be one with the Astral Light, or Plastic Medium, or 
Aub, Aud, Aur (these three being a Trinity) of which our 
own Sages have spoken. And this Meditation may bring 
forth much Knowledge physical, which is good, for that 
which is above is Ake that which is beneath, and the Study 
of any Law leadeth to the understanding of all Law. So 
mayst thou learn in the End that there is no Law beyond 
Do what thou wilt. 
56 
DE NECESSITATE VOLUNTATIS 
AND how then (sayst thou?) shall I reconcile this Art 
Magick with that Way of the Tao which achieveth all 
Things by doing Nothing? But this have I already declared 
to thee in Part, shewing that thou canst do no Magick save 
it be thy Nature to do Magick, and so the true Nothing 
for thee. For to do Nothing signifieth to interfere with 
Nothing, so that for a Magician to do no Magick is to com-
mit Violence on himself. Yet learn also that all Action 
is in some sense Magick, being an essential part of that 
Great Magical Work which we call Nature. Then thou 
hast no Free Will? Verily, thou hast said. Yet never the 
less it is thy necessary Destiny to act with that Free Will. 
Thou canst do nothing save in accordance with that Nature 
of thine and of all Things, and every Phenomenon is the 
Resultant of the Totality of Forces: Amen. Then thou 
needst take no Thought and make no Effort? Thou sayest 
sooth; yet, art thou not compelled to Thought and Effort 
in the Way of Nature? Yea, I, thy Father, work for thee 
solicitously, and also I laugh at thy Perplexities; for so was 
it foreordained that I should do, by Me, from the Begin-
ning. 
57 
DE COMOEDIA UNIVERSA, QUAE DICITUR BAN 
therefore, o my Son, count thyself happy when thou 
understandest all these Things, being one of those 
Beings (or By-comings) whom we call Philosophers. All is 
a never-ending Play of Love wherein Our Lady Nuit and 
Her Lord Hadit rejoice; and every Part of the Play is Play 
All Pain is but sharp Sauce to the Dish of Pleasure; for it 
is the Nature of the Universe that hath devised this ever-
lasting Banquet of Joy. And he that knoweth not this is 
necessary as an Ingredient even as thou art; wouldst thou 
change all, and spoil the Dish? Art thou the Master-Cook? 
Yea, for thy Palate is become fine with thy great 
Dalliance with the Food of Experience; therefore thou 
art one of them that rejoice. Also it is thy Nature as it is 
mine, o my Son, to will that all men share our Mirth and 
Jollity; wherefore have I proclaimed my Law to Man, 
and thou continuest in that Work of Joyaunce. 
58 
DE CAECITIA HOMINUM 
LEARN also of my Wisdom that this Vision of the Cosmos 
whereof I have here written unto thee is not given unto 
thy Sight at all Times; for in that Vision is all Will ful-
filled. Thou seest the Universe as Non; and as One, 
and as Many, and thou seest the Play thereof and there-
with art thou (who art no longer thou) content. For in one 
Phase art thou also None, in another One, and in the third 
an organized and necessary Part of that great Structure, 
so that there is no more Conflict at all in thy whole By-
coming. But now will I make Light for thine Eyes in this 
Matter as thou gropest, asking: but of them that see not 
this, what sayest thou, o my Father? But in that Vision 
thou sayest not thus, my Son! Learn then of me the Secret 
Mystery of Illusion, and how it worketh, and of the Holy 
Law that is its Nature, and of thine Action therein; for 
this is an Arcanum of the Wisdom of the Magi, and proper 
unto thee that dwellest in the Land of Understanding. 
59 
ALLEGORIA DE CAISSA 
CONSIDER for an example the Game and Play of the 
Chess, which is a Pastime of Man, and worthy to exer-
cise him in Thought, yet by no means necessary to his Life, 
so that he sweepeth away Board and Pieces at the least 
Summons of that which is truly dear to him. Thus unto 
him this Game is as it were an Illusion. But insofar as he 
entereth into the Game he abideth by the Rules thereof, 
though they be of Artifice and in no wise proper to his 
Nature; for in this Restriction is all his Pleasure. There-
fore, though he hath All-Power to move the Pieces at his 
own Will, he doth it not, enduring Loss, Indignity, and 
Defeat rather than destroy that Artifice of Illusion. Think 
then that thou hast thyself created this Shadowworld the 
Universe, and that it pleasureth thee to watch or to 
actuate its Play according to the Law that thou hast made, 
which yet bindeth thee not save only by Virtue of thine 
own Will to thine own Pleasure therein. 
60 
DE VERITATE FALSI 
MOREOVER this Matter toucheth the Nature of Truth. 
For although to thee in thy True Self, absolute and 
without conditions, all this Universe, which is relative and 
conditioned, is an Illusion; yet to that Part of thee by 
which thou perceivest it, the Law of its Being (or By-com-
ing) is a Law of Truth. Learn then that all Relations are 
true upon their own Plane, and that it would be a Viola, 
tion of Nature to adjust them skew-wise. Thus, albeit thou 
hast found Thy Self, and knowest Thy Self immortal and 
immutable, beyond Time and Space, free of Causality, so 
throughly that even thy Mind partaketh constantly there-
of, thou hast in no wise altered the Relations of thy Body 
with its Syndromies in the World whereof it is a Part. 
Wouldst thou lengthen the Life of thy Body? Then accom-
modate thou the Conditions of thy Body to its Environ-
ment by giving it Light, Air, Food, and Exercise as its Na-
ture requireth. So also, mutatis mutandis, do thou cherish 
the Health of thy Mind. 
61 
DE RELATIONE ILLUSIONUM 
OF this will I speak further with thee, for here behold a 
great Rock of Ignorance on the one Hand, and on the 
other a Whirlpool of Error; in this Strait are many Wrecks 
of Magick Ships. Knowest thou not that Riddle of old, 
whether it be lawful to pay Tribute to Cwsar or no? Give 
therefore to the Body the things of the Body, and to the 
Mind the things of the Mind. Yet because of the Interior 
Harmony of all Things that proceedeth from their Original 
One Nature, there is Action and Reaction of the one upon 
the other, as I have already set forth in this mine Epistle. 
But Law is universal, and between these two Kinds of 
Illusion there is an ordered Proportion, and it is proper to 
thy Science to delimit and describe this Law of Interac-
tion ; for to deny it wholly (as to extend it to Infinity) is 
Folly, born of Ignorance, Idleness, and Incapacity to ob-
serve Fact. 
62 
DE PRUDENTIA 
CONSIDER Drunkenness, how by Variation of bodily 
Conditions thou mayst alter its Effect upon the Mind, 
and the contrary, remembering the Discipline of Theo-
phrastus Paracelsus, how, opposing Wine to bodily Exer-
cise, he obtained a certain Purification and Exaltation. 
Yet, were he seven times greater, he had not done this 
with Oil of Vitriol. Learn then that there are certain 
definite Channels of Action and Reaction beween Body 
and Mind; sound these, and trim thy Sails accordingly, 
not thinking that thou art in the open Sea. And if so be 
that thou in thy Sounding findest new Channels, rejoice, 
and map them for the Profit of thy Fellows; but remem-
ber constantly that to find one new Way up a Precipice 
removeth not the Precipice. For where thou, o Angel and 
yet Maxi, hast trod delicately albeit without Fear Fools 
will rush in to their Destruction. 
63 
DE RATIONE MAGI VITAE 
STUDY thou Logic, which is the Code of the Laws of 
Thought. Study the Method of Science, which is the 
Application of Logic to the Facts of the Universe. Think 
not that thou canst ever abrogate these Laws, for though 
they be Limitations, they are the Rules of thy Game which 
thou dost play. For in thy Trances though thou becomest 
That which is not subject to those Laws, they are still final 
in respect of those Things which thou hast set them to 
govern. Nay, o my Son, this Word govern, liketh me not, 
for a Law is but a Statement of the Nature of the Thing 
to which it applieth. For nothing is compelled save only 
by Virtue of its own true Will. So therefore human Law 
is a Statement of the Will and of the Nature of Man, or else 
it is a Falsity contrary thereunto, and becometh null and 
of none Effect. 
64 
DE CORDE CANDID° 
THINK also, o my Son, of this Image, that if two States 
be at Peace, a Man goeth between them without let; but 
if there be War, all Gateways are forthwith closed, save 
only for a few, and these are watched and guarded, so 
that the Obstacles are many. This then is the case of 
Magick; for if thou have brought to Harmony all Principles 
within thee, thou mayst work easily to transmute a Force 
, into its semblable upon another Plane, which is the essen-
tial Opus of our Art; but if thou be at War within thyself, 
how canst thou work? For our Master Hermes Trisme-
gistus hath written at the Head of his Tablet of Emerald 
this Word: That which is above is like that which is below, 
and that which is below is like that which is above, 
for the Performance of the Miracles of the One Substance. 
How then, if these be not alike? If the Substance of Thee 
be Two, and not One? And herein is the Need of the 
Confession of a Pure Heart, as it is written in the Papyrus 
of the Dead. 
65 
DE CONFORMITATE MAGI 
SEE to it therefore, o my Son, that thou in thy Working 
dost no Violence to the Whole Will of the AIL or to the 
Will common to all those Beings (or By-comings) that are 
of one general Nature with thee, or to thine own particular 
Will. For first of all thou art necessarily moved toward 
the One End from thine own Station, but secondly thou 
art moved toward the End proper to thine own Race, and 
Caste, and Family, as by Virtue of thy Birth. And these 
are, I may say it, Conditions or Limits of thine own indi-
vidual Will. Thou dost laugh? What, sayest thou, of the 
Revolutionary Will? Err not, my Son! The Magus, even 
as the Poet, is the Expression of the True Will of his 
Fellows; and his Success is his Proof, as it is written 
in the Book of the Law. For his Work is to free Men from 
the Fetters of a false or superannuated Will, revealing 
to them, in Measure attuned to their present Needs, their 
true Natures. 
66 
DE POETIS 
FOR this Reason is the Poet called an Incarnation of the 
Zeitgeist, that is, of the Spirit or Will of his Period. So 
every Poet is also a Prophet, because when that which he 
sayeth is recognized as the Nxpression of their own 
Thought by Men, they translate this into Act, so that, in 
the Parlance of Folk vulgar and ignorant, "that which he 
foretold is come to pass." Now then the Poet is Interpreter 
of the Hieroglyphs of the Hidden Will of Man in many a 
Matter, some light, some deep, as it may be given unto 
him to do. Moreover, it is not altogether in the Word of 
any Poem, but in the quintessential Flavour of the Poet, 
that thou mayst seek this Prophecy. And this is an Art 
most necessary to every Statesman. Who but Shelley fore-
told the fel/ of Christianity, and the Organization of La-
bour, and the Freedom of Woman; who but Nietzsche 
declared the Principle at the Root of the World-War? See 
thou clearly then that in these Men were the Keys of the 
dark Gates of the Future; should not the Kings and their 
Ministers have taken heed thereto, fulfilling their Word 
without Conflict? 
67 
DE MAGIS ORDINIS A. • . A. • . QUIBUS CARO 
FIT VERBUM 
I \TOW, o my Son, the Incarnation of a Poet, is particular 
and not Universal; he sayeth indeed true Things, but 
not the Things of All-Truth. And that these may be said 
it is necessary that One take human Flesh, and become a 
Magus in our Holy Order. He then is called the Logos, 
or Logos Aionos, that is to say, the Word of the Aeon or 
Age, because He is verily That Word. And thus may He 
be known, because He hath it given unto Him to prepare 
the Quintessence of the Will of God, that is, of Man, in 
its Fullness and Wholeness, comprehending all Planes; 
so that His Law is simple, and radical, penetrating all 
Space from its single Light. For though His Words be 
many, yet is His Word One, One and Alone; and by this 
Word he createth Man anew, in an Essential Form of Life, 
so that he is changed in his inmost Knowledge of himself. 
And this Change worketh outwards, little by little, unto 
its visible Effects. 
68 
DE MAGIS TEMPORIS ANTIQUI; IMPRIMIS, 
DE LAO-TZE 
IT may be unto thy Profit, o my Son, ill relate unto thee 
the secret History of those who have gone before me in 
this Grade of Magus, so far as Their Memory hath remain-
ed among Mankind. For what would it avail thee should I 
recount the deeds of Those whom I indeed may know, 
but thou not? Thou knowest well how I keep me from 
all Taint of Fable, or of any Word unproven or unclemon-
strable. First then I speak of Lao-tze, whose Word was 
TAO. Hereof have I already written much unto thee, be-
cause His Doctrine hath been lost or misinterpreted, and 
it is most needful to restore it. For this Tao is the true 
Nature of Things, being itself a Way or Going, that is, a 
kinetic and not a static Conception. Also He taught this 
Way of Harmony in Will, which I myself have sought to 
shew thee in this Epistle. So then this Tao is Truth, and 
the Way of Truth, and therefore was Lao-Tze Logos of His 
Aeon, and His true Word or Name was TAO. 
69 
DE GAUT AMA 
WHOM men call Gautama, or Siddartha, or The Buddha, 
was a Magus of Our Holy Order. And His Word was 
ANATTA; for the Root of His whole Doctrine was that 
there is no Atman, or Soul, as Men ill translate it, meaning 
a Substance incapable of Change. Thus He, like Lao-tze, 
based all upon a Movement, instead of a fixed Point. And 
His Way of Truth was Analysis, made possible by great 
Intention of the Mind towards itself, and that well fortified 
by a certain tempered Rigour of Life. And He most thor-
oughly explored and mapped out the Fastnesses of the 
Mind, and gave the Keys of its Fortresses into the Hands 
of Man. But of all this the Quintessence is in this one 
Word ANATTA, because this is not only the Foundation 
and the Result of His whole Doctrine, but the Way of its 
Work. 
70 
DE SRI KRISHNA, ET DE DIONYSO 
KRISHNA hath names and forms innumerable, and I 
know not his true human Birth. For his Formula is of 
the major Antiquity. But His Word hath spread into many 
lands, and we know it to-day as INRI with the secret IAO 
concealed therein. And the meaning of this Word is the 
Way of the Working of Nature in Her Changes; that is, it is 
the Formula of Magick whereby all Things reproduce and 
recreate themselves. Yet this Extension and Specialization 
was rather the Word of Dionysus; for the true Word ot 
Krishna was AUM, importing rather a statement of the 
Truth of Nature than a practical Instruction in detailed 
Operations of Magick. But Dionysus, by the Word INRI, 
laid the Foundations of all Science, as we say Science 
to-day in a particular Sense, that is, of causing external 
Nature to change in Harmony with our Wills. 
71 
DE TAHUTI 
TAHUTI, or Thoth, confirmed the Word of Dionysus by 
continuing it; for He shewed how by the Mind it was 
possible to direct the Operations of the Will. By Criticism 
and by recorded Memory Man avoideth Error, and the 
Repetition of Error. But the true Word of Tahuti was 
AMOUN, whereby He made Men to understand their 
secret Nature, that is, their Unity with their True Selves, 
or, as they then phrased it, with God. And he discovered 
unto them the Way of this Attainment, and its relation 
with the Formula of INTO. Also by his Mystery of Number 
he made plain the Path for His Successor to declare the 
Nature of the whole Universe in its Form and in its Struc-
ture, as it were an Analysis thereof, doing for Matter what 
the Buddha was decreed to do for Mind. 
72 
DE QUODAM MACK) AEGYPTIORUM, QUEM 
APPELUNT JUDAEI MOSHEH 
THE Follower of Tahuti was an Egyptian whose name is 
lost; but the Jews called Him Mosheh, or Moses, and 
their Fabulists made Him the Leader of their legendary 
Exodus. Yet they preserved His Word, and it is IFIVH, 
which thou must understand also as that secret Word 
which thou hast seen and heard in Thunders and Light-
nings in thine Initiation to the Degree thou wottest of. 
But this Word is itself a Plan of the Fabrick of the Uni-
verse, and upon it hath been elaborated the Holy Qabalah, 
whereby we have Knowledge of the Natures of all Things 
soever upon every plane of By-coming, and of their Forces 
and Tendencies and Operations, with the Keys to their 
Portals. Nor did He leave any Part of His Work unfinished, 
unless it be that accomplished three hundred Years ago 
by Sir Edward Kelly, of whom also I come, as thou know-
est. 
73 
DE MAGO ARABICO MOHAMMED 
BEHOLD! in these chapters have I thy Father restricted 
myself, not speaking of any immediate Echo of a Word 
in the World, because, these men being long since with-
drawn into Their Silence, it is Their One Word, and that 
Alone, that resoundeth undiminished through Time. Now 
Mohammed, who followeth, is darkened and confused by 
his nearness to our own Time, so that I say not save with 
Diffidence that His Word ALLH may mean this or that. 
But Tam bold concerning His Doctrine of the Unity of God, 
for God is Man, and He said therefore: Man is One. And 
His Will was to unite all men in One Reasonable Faith: 
to make possible Co-operation of all Races in Science. 
Yet, because he arose in the time of the greatest possible 
Corruption and Darkness, when every Civilization and 
every Religion had fallen into Ruin, by the Malice of the 
great Sorcerer of Nazareth, as some say, He is still hidden 
in the Dust of the Simoom, and we may not perceive Him 
in His true Self of Glory. 
Nevertheless, behold, o my Son, this Mystery. His true 
Word was LA ALLH that is to say: (There is) No God, and 
LA AL is that Mystery of Mysteries which thine own Eye 
pierced in thine Initiation. And of that Truth have the 
Illusion and Falsehood enslaved the Souls of Men, as 
it is written in the Book of the Magus. 
74 
DE SE IPSO 
TRI MEVAAM 0EPH21, TM A01121 AIUNOE, 
CUJTJS VERBUM EST 
13Anpa 
11 MY Son! me seemeth in certain Hours that I am myself 
fallen on a Time even more fearful and fatal than did 
Mohammed, peace be upon Him! But I read clearly the 
Word of the Aeon, that is ABRAHADABRA wherein is the 
whole Mystery of the Great Work, as thou knowest. And 
I have the Book of the Law, that was given unto me by 
Him thou wottest of; and it is the Interpretation of the 
Secret Will of Man on every plane of his By-coming; and 
the Word of the Law is THELEMA, Do what thou wilt 
shall be the whole of the Law. Now because Love is the 
law, love under will, do I write this Epistle for thee, that 
thou mayst fulfil this inmost Will of Mankind making them 
capable of Light, Life, Love and Liberty by the Accept-
ance of this Law. And the Hindrance thereunto is but as 
the Shell of its Egg to an Eaglet, a Thing foreign to itself, 
a Protection until the Hour strike, and then an End 
thereof. 
75 
MANDATUM AD FILITJM SUUM 
HERE I reach forth mine Hands against thee in the Sign 
of the Enterer, o Son of my Bowels, for with all my 
magical Might I will that thou fight manfully and labour 
with Diligence (with Sword and Trowel, say I) in this 
Work. For this is the first and last of all, that thou bid 
every Man do what he will, in Accord with his own true 
Nature. Therefore also blast thou that Lie that Man is of a 
fallen and evil Nature. For the Word of Sin is Restriction, 
the Doubt of his own Godhead, the Suppression of, which 
is the Blasphemy against, his own Holy Spirit. Saith not 
the Book of the Law that "It is a lie, this folly against 
self"? Therefore to every Man, in every Circumstance, 
say thou: Do what thou wilt; and teach him, if he yet 
waver, how to discover his true Nature, earnestly and 
with Ardour, even as I have striven to teach thee—yea, 
and more also! 
76 
QUARE FILIUM CREAVIT: TIT FIAT LIBERTAS 
DO what thou wilt !—be this our Slogan of Battle in 
every Act; for every Act is Conflict. There Victory 
leapeth shining before us; for who may thwart True Will, 
which is the Order of Nature Herself? Thou hast no Right 
but to do thy Will; Do that, and no other shall say nay. For 
if that Will be true, its Fulfilment is of a Surety as Day-
light following Sunrise. It is certain as the Operation of 
any other Law of Nature; it is Destiny. Then, if that Will 
be obscured, if thou turn from it to Wills diseased or per-
verse, how canst thou hope? Fool! Even thy Turns and 
Twists are in the Path to thine appointed End. But thou 
art not sprung of a Slave's Loins; thou standest firm and 
straight; thou dost thy Will; and thou art chosen, nay, for 
this Work wast thou begotten in a Magick Bed, that thou 
shouldst make Men free. 
77 
DE STJA DEBILITATE 
LISTEN attentively, my Son, while I with heavy Heart 
make Confession to thee of mine own Frailty. Thou 
knowest that I made Renunciation of my Wage, taking this 
Body immediately after my Death, the Death of Eli-
phaz Levi Zahed, as Men say, that I might attain to this 
Great Work. It is now twenty Years, as Men count years, 
that I came to my first Understanding of my true Nature, 
and aspired to that Work. Now then at the first I made no 
Error. I abandoned my chosen Career; I poured out my 
whole Fortune without one Thought; I gave my Life up 
utterly to the Work without keeping back the least imag-
inable Thing. So then I made swift Strides along the Path. 
But in the Dhyanas that were granted unto me in Kandy, 
in the Island of Lanka, I used up my whole Charge of 
magical Energy; and for two Years I fell away from the 
Work. 
78 
DE MANU QUAE MAGUM SUSTINET 
NOW it may well be that such Periods of Recuperation 
are Necessary to such weak Souls as mine; and so no 
Ill. But I fell from my Will, and sought other Ends in Life; 
and so the Hand came upon me, and tore away that which 
I desired, as thou knowest; also it is written in The Temple 
of Solomon the King. Yet consider also these two Years 
as a necessary Preparation for that greatest of all Events 
which befell me in El-Kahira, in the Land of Khem, the 
Choice of me as the Word of the Aeon. Now then for 
awhile I worked with my Will, though not wholly; and 
again the Hand reached forth and smote me. This, albeit 
my Slackness was but as a Boy playing Truant, not a 
Revolt against my Self. Wherefore, despite all, I made 
much Progress in short Time. 
79 
DE SUO PECCATO 
NOW then, well schooled, I strove no more against my 
Nature, and worked with all my Will. Thou knowest 
well how greatly I was rewarded. Yet in this last Initiation 
to the Grade of Magus, wherein three-and-seventy Days, 
as Men count Days, is but One Day, the Ordeal grew so 
fierce and so intolerable that I gave back a Step. I did not 
utterly renounce the Work, but I swore not to continue 
unless mine Agony were abated. But after fifteen Days, I 
came to myself in a certain Ordeal, wherein I knew myself 
finally, that I could not do other than take up that fearful 
Burden that had broken my Spirit. And for those fifteen 
Days have I not suffered infinite Things? Was not the Tree 
of my Work frozen, one Branch withered, and one blasted? 
Look no more, o my Son, upon thy Father's Shame! 
80 
DE SUA VICTORIA PER NOMEN BABALON 
AND after? This Dawn (for I have toiled through the 
Night in my great Love and Care of thee) how is it 
with me? It is well. For I have found myself; I have found 
my Will; the Obstacles that daunted me are seen to be but 
Shadows of Shadows. Grace be unto our Lady BABALON. 
Thus it is written in the Book of the Law: Remember 
all ye that existence is pure joy; that all the sorrows are 
but as shadows; they pass 8z are done; but there is that 
which remains. 
Learn then that it is in the Contemplation of Division 
that Sorrow is, for Division is the Formula of Choronzon. 
It is therefore discreet for thee to unite each Element of 
Sorrow with its opposite; in whose Triumph of Hymen is 
Ecstasy, until by the Apprehension of the new great Op-
posite the Idea is again seen as Sorrow. This then is the 
Issue from Sorrow; and thou mayst understand that I now 
also am confident in the Necessity of this my Fall to pre-
pare the Formula of Mine Exaltation. Therefore, my Son, 
thus hail Me: Blessing and Worship to the Beast, the 
Prophet of the Lovely Star. 
81 
DE ARCANO NEFANDO 
oMY Son, learn this concerning Magick, that the Yang 
moveth, and thus giveth itself up Eternally; but the 
Yin moveth not, seeking ever to enclose or restrict, repro-
ducing in its own Likeness what Impression soever is made 
thereon, yet without Surrender. Now the Tao absorbeth all 
without Reproduction; so then let the Yang turn thereto, 
and not unto the Yin. And that thou mayst understand 
this, I say: It is a Mystery of O.T.O. For the Sun ariseth 
not and entereth to strike upon the High Altar of the 
Minster by the Great Western Gates, but by the Rose 
Oriel doth he make Way and Progress in His Pageant. Oh 
my Son ;  the Doors of Silver are wide open, and they tempt 
thee with their Beauty; but by the narrow Portal of Pure 
Gold shalt thou come more nobly to the Sanctuary. Be-
hold! thou knowest not how perfect is this Magick; it is 
the dearest-bought and holiest of our Arcana. What then 
is like unto my Love toward Thee, that bestoweth upon 
thee this Treasure of my Wisdom? My son, neglect it not; 
for it is the Exorcism of Exorcisms, and the Enchantment 
of Enchantments. 
82 
DE ARCANO, PER QUOD SPIRITUS QUIDAM 
IN CORPORE RECIPIATUR 
HERE now is another Formula of Power, good to invoke 
any Being to manifest in thyself. First, invoke him by 
the Power of all thy Spells and Conjurations, with Mind 
concentrated and Will vehement, toward him, as I have 
written in many Books. But because thou art NEMO, thou 
mayst safely invoke him, no matter of what Nature, within 
thy Circle. Now then do thou confer on him as the Guer-
don of his Obedience the Dignity of a Soul seeking Incar-
nation, and so proceed to consecrate thine Act by per-
forming the Mass of the Holy Ghost. Then shall that 
Spirit make himself Body from those Elements; and thou 
partaking thereof makest thine own Body his Machinery 
of Manifestation. And thus mayst thou work with any 
Spirit soever; yet this shall serve thee most in common 
Life. Also, the Qualities are well defined in the Cards of 
the Tarot, so that thou hast a clear-cut Means of develop-
ing thy Powers according to the Need of the Time. But 
learn also this, to work constantly under the Guidance of 
thine Holy Guardian Angel, so that thy Workings be 
alway in Harmony and Accord with thy True Will. 
83 
DE CLAW KABBALISTICA HUJUS ARTIS 
NOW then to thee who art long since Master of High 
Magick, it will be easy to shew how the Mass of the 
Holy Ghost, sung even in Ignorance, may work many a 
Wonder by Virtue of the Force generated being compelled 
to manifest on other than its own Plane. Here then is a 
Theory of the Mystery of the Aeon, that I, being the Logos 
appointed thereunto, did create an Image of my Little 
Universe in the Mind of the Woman of Scarlet; that is, I 
manifested mine whole Magical Self in her Mind. Thus 
then in Her, as in a Mirror, have I been able to interpret 
myself to myself. Thou also in thine own Way hast the 
Power to create such an Image; but be thou sure and alert, 
testing constantly the Persons in that Image by the Holy 
Qabalah and by the True Signs of Brotherhood. For each 
Person therein shall be a Part of Thy Self, made individ-
ual and perfect, able to instruct thee in thy Path. Yet often 
there shall be others, that are to aid thee in thy Working, 
or to oppose it. And in this Matter thou shalt read especial-
ly the Record of thy Father his Working with Soror Ahitha 
(blessed be Her Name unto the Ages!) and certain others 
to Boot. 
84 
DE MISSA SPIRITUS SANCTI 
NOW at last, o my Son, may I bring thee to understand 
the Truth of this Formula that is hidden in the Mass 
of the Holy Ghost. For Horus that is Lord of the Aeon is 
the Child crowned and conquering. The Formula of Osiris 
was, as thou knowest, a Word of Death, that is, the Force 
lay long in Darkness, and by Putrefaction came to Resur-
rection. But we take living Things, and pour in Life and 
Spirit of the Nature of our own Will, so that instantly and 
without Corruption the Child (as it were the Word of that 
Will) is generated; and again immediately taketh up his 
Habitation among us to manifest in Force and Fire. This 
Mass of the Holy Ghost is then the true Formula of the 
Magick of the Aeon, even of the Aeon of Horus, blessed 
be He in His Name Ra-Hoor-Khuit! And thou shalt bless 
also the Name of our Father Merlin, Frater Superior of the 
0.T.O., for that by Seven Years of Apprenticeship in His 
School did I discover this most excellent Way of Magick. 
Be thou diligent, o my Son, for in this wondrous Art is no 
more Toil, Sorrow, and Disappointment, as it was in the 
dead Aeon of the Slain Gods. 
85 
DE FORMULA TOTA 
HERE then is thy Schedule for all Operations of Magick. 
First: thou shalt discover thy True Will, as I have 
already taught thee and that Bud thereof which is the 
Purpose of this Operation. 
Next, formulate this Bud-Will as a Person, seeking or 
constructing it, and naming it, according to thine Holy 
Qabalah, and its infallible Rule of Truth. 
Third: purify and consecrate this Person, concentrating 
upon him, and against all else. This Preparation shall 
continue in all thy daily Life. Mark well: make ready a 
New Child immediately after every Birth. 
Fourth: make an especial and direct Invocation at thy 
Mass, before the Introit, formulating a visible Image of 
this Child, and offering the Right of Incarnation. 
Fifth: perform the Mass, not omitting the Epiklesis, and 
let there be a Golden Wedding Ring at the Marriage of thy 
Lion with thine Eagle. 
Sixth: at the Consumption of the Eucharist accept this 
Child, losing thy Consciousness in him, until he be well 
assimilated within thee. 
Now then do this continuously, for by Repetition cometh 
forth both Strength and Skill, and the Effect is cumulative, 
if thou allow no time for it to dissipate itself. 
86 
DE HAC FORMULA CONSIDERATIONES 
KABBALISTICAE 
BEHOLD moreover, my son, the (Economy of this Way, 
how it is according to the Tao, fulfilling itself wholly 
within thine own Sphere. And it is utterly in Tune with 
thine own Will on every Plane, so that every Part of thy 
Nature rejoiceth with every other Part, communicating 
Praise. Now then learn also how this Formula is that of 
the Word ABRAHADABRA. First, HAD is the Triangle 
erect upon twin Squares. Of Hadit need I not to write, for 
He hath hidden Himself in the Book of the Law. The 
Substance is the Father, the Instrument is the Son, and 
the Metaphysical Ecstasy is the Holy Ghost, whose name 
is HRILIU. These are then the Sun, Mercury and Venus, 
whose sacred Letters are R, B, and 0. But the last of the 
diverse Letters is H, which in the Tarot is The Star whose 
Eidolon is D; and herein is that Arcanum concerning the 
Tao of which I have already written. Of this will I not 
write more plainly. But mark this, that our Trinity is our 
Path Inwards in the Solar System, and that H being of 
Our Lady NUIT Starry, is an Anchor to this Magick 
which else were apt to deny our Wholeness of Relation 
to the Outer as to the Inner. My Son, ponder these Words, 
and profit by them; for I have wrought cunningly to 
conceal or to reveal, according to thine Intelligence, o my 
Son! 
87 
DE QUIBUSDAM ARTIST'S MAGICIS 
NOW of those Operations of Magick by which thou seek- 
est to display unto some other Person the Righteous-
ness of thy Will I make haste to instruct thee. First, if 
thou have a reasonable Link with him by Word or Letter, 
it is most natural simply to create in thyself, as I have 
taught, a Child or Bud-Will, and let that radiate from thee 
through the Channel aforesaid. But if thou have no Link, 
the Case is otherwise, and is not easy. Here thou mayst 
make Communication through others, as it were by Relays ;  
or thou mayst act directly upon his Aura by magicathleans, 
such as the Projection of thy Scin-Laeca But unless he 
be sensitive and well-attuned, thou mayst fare but ill. Yet 
even in this Case thou mayst attain much Skill by Practice 
with Intelligence. In the End it is better altogether to work 
wholly within thine own Universe, slowly and with firm 
Steps advancing from the Centre, and dealing, one by one, 
with those unharmonised Parts of the Not-Self which lie 
close to thee, and impinge upon thee. This therefore 
closeth the Circle of my Speech, for now am I returned to 
that which I spake aforetime concerning the general 
Method of Love, and thy Development by that Way. 
88 
DE MAGNO OPERE 
BUT now give Ear most eagerly, thou Son of my Loins, 
for I will now discourse unto thee of thine own Attain-
ment, without which all is but Idleness. Know first that 
conscious Thought is but phenomenal, the Noise of thy 
Machine. Now Chemistry, or Al-Chem-y meaneth the 
Egyptian Science, and the True Magick of Egypt hath this 
for its Foundation. We have in our House many Sub-
stances which act directly upon the Blood, and many 
Practices of Virtue similar, to stimulate, compose, purify, 
analyse, direct, or concentrate the Thought. Confer the 
Book of the Law, II, 22. But this Action is subtle and 
of many Modes, and dependeth heavily on the Conditions 
of the Experiment, whereof the First is thine own 
Will therein. Therefore I say unto thee that this is thy 
Work immediate and necessary, to discover openly thy 
Will unto thyself, and to fortify and enkindle it by 
all One-Pointedness of Thought and Action, so that 
thou mayst direct it inwards unto its Core, that is Thyself 
in Thy Name HADIT. For thereby is thy Will made white 
with Heat so that no Dross may cling to it. But this Work 
is the Great Work, and standeth alone. 
89 
DE GRADIBUS AD MAGNUM OPUS 
THIS Great Work is the Attainment of the Knowledge 
and Conversation of Thine Holy Guardian Angel. In 
the Eighth Aethyr is the Way thereof revealed. But I say: 
prepare thyself most heartily and well for that Battle of 
Love by all means of Magick. Make thyself puissant, 
wise, radiant in every System, and balance thyself well 
in thine Universe. Then with a pure Will tempered in the 
thousand Furnaces of thy Trials, burn up thyself within 
thy Self. In the Preparation thou shalt have learned how 
thou mayst still all Thoughts, and reach Ecstasy of Trance 
in many Modes. But in these Marriages thy conscious Self 
is Bridegroom, and the not-Self Bride, while in this Great 
Work thou givest up that conscious Self as Bride to thy 
True Self. This Operation is then radically alien from all 
others. And it is hard, because it is a total Reversal of the 
Current of the Will, and a Transmutation of its Formula 
and Nature. Here, o my Son, is the One Secret of Success 
in this Great Work: Invoke Often. 
90 
DE FORMULA LUNAE 
THUS then concerning Operations of the Tao with the 
Yang and the Yin is there enough; for thine own Art of 
Beauty shall divine for thee, and devise new Heavens. But 
in all these is the Formula of the Serpent with the Head of 
the Lion, and all this Magick is wrought by the Radiance 
and Creative Force thereof. And this Force leapeth con-
tinually from Plane to Plane, and breaketh forth from his 
Bonds, so that Constraint is Labour. Now then learn that 
the Yin hath also a Formula of Force. And the nature of 
the Yin is to be still, and to encircle or limit, and it is as a 
Mirror, reflecting diverse Images without Change in its 
own Kind. So then it seeketh never to overleap the Bar-
riers of its Plane; for this Reason it is well to use it in Oper-
ations of a very definite and restricted Type. But although 
it be inert, yet is it most subject to Change; for its number 
is four Score and one, which is The Moon. And these are 
ALIM, the Gods elemental before H, descending in their 
midst, made them Creative. So then thou mayst use con-
stantly this Formula to re-arrange Things in their own 
Planes; and this is a most pragmatick Consideration. 
91 
DE AQUILA SUME,NDA 
TAKE in this Work the Eagle all undefiled and virginal 
for thy Sacrament. And thy Technick is the Magick 
of Water, so that thine Act is of Nourishment, and not of 
Generation. Therefore the Prime use of this Art is to 
build up thine own Nature. But if thou hast skill to 
control the Mood of the Eagle, then mayst thou work many 
an admirable Effect upon thine Environment. Thou 
knowest how great is the Fame of Witch-Women (old and 
without Man) to cause Events, although they create noth-
ing. It is this Straitness of the Channel which giveth 
force to the Stream. Beware, o my Son, lest thou cling 
overmuch to this Mode of Magick; for it is lesser than 
That Other, and if thou neglect That Other, then is thy 
Danger fearful and imminent, for it is the Edge of the 
Abyss of Choronzon, where are the lonely Towers of the 
Black Brothers. Also, the Formulation of the Object in 
the Eagle is by a species of Intoxication, so that His Na-
ture is of Dream or Delirium, and thus there may be 
Illusion. For this Cause I deem it not wholly unwise if 
thou use this Way of Magick chiefly as a Cordial; that is, 
for the Fortifying of thine own Nature. 
92 
DE MEDICINIS SECIINDUM QUATTUOR ELEMENTA 
CONCERNING the Use of Chymical Agents, and be 
mindful that thou abuse them not, learn that the Sac-
rament itself relateth to Spirit, and the Four Elements 
balanced thereunder, in its Perfection. So also thy Lion 
himself hath a fourfold Menstruum for his Serpents. 
Now to Fire belong Cocaine, which fortifieth the Will, 
loosening him from bodily Fatigue, Morphine, which pu-
rifieth the Mind, making the Thought safe, and slow, and 
single, Heroin, which partaketh, as it seemeth, of the 
Nature of these twain aforesaid, albeit in Degree less 
notable than either of them, and Alcohol, which is Food, 
that is, Fuel, for the whole Man. To Water, attribute 
Hashish and Mescal, for they make Images, and they open 
the Hidden Springs of Pleasure and of Beauty. Mor-
phine, for its Ease, hath also part in Water. Air ruleth 
Ethyl Oxide, for it is as a Sword, dividing asunder every 
Part of thee, making easy the Way of Analysis, so that 
thou cornest to learn thyself, of what Elements thou art 
compact. Lastly, of the Nature of Earth are the direct 
Hypnotics, which operate by Repose, and restore thy 
Strength by laying thee as a Child in the Arms of the 
Great Mother, I say rather of Her material and physio-
logical Viceregent.

DE VIRTUTE EXPERIENTIAE IN HAC ARTE 
NOT Sleep, not Rest, not Peace, not Contentment are of 
the Will of the Hero; but these Things he hateth, and 
consenteth to enjoy them only with Shame of his weak 
Nature. But he will analyse himself without Pity, and 
he will do all things soever that may free and fortify his 
Mind and Will. Know that the Technick of the Right 
Use of these Magick Poisons is subtle; and since the Na-
ture of every Man differeth from that of his Fellow, there 
entereth Idiosyncrasy, and thine Experience shall be thy 
Master in this Art. Heed also this word following: the 
Right Use of these Agents is to gain a Knowledge prelim-
inary of thine own Powers, and of High States, so that 
thou goest not altogether blindly and without Aim in thy 
Quest, ignorant of the Keys to thine own inner Being. 
Also, thou must work alway for a definite End, never for 
Pleasure or for Relaxation, except thou wilt, as a good 
Knight is sworn to do. And thou being Hero and Magi-
cian art in Peril of abusing the Fiery Agents only, not 
those of Earth, Air, or Water; because these do really 
work with Thee in Purity, making thee wholly what thou 
wouldst be, an Engine indefatigable, a Mind clear, calm 
and concentrated, and a Heart fierce aglow. 
94 
DE SACRAMENTO VERO 
BUT in the Sacrament of the Gnosis, which is of the 
Spirit, is there naught hurtful, for its Elements are 
not only Food, but a true Incarnation and Quintessence 
of Life, Love, and Liberty, and at its Manifestation thy 
Lion is consecrated by pure Light of Ecstasy. Also, as 
this is the strongest, so also is it the most sensitive of all 
Things soever, and both proper and ready to take impress 
of Will, not as a Seal passively, but with true Recreation 
in a Microcosm thereof. And this is a God alive and 
puissant to create, and He is a Word of Magick wherein 
thou mayst read Thyself with all thine History and all 
thy Possibility. Also as to thine Eagle, is not this chosen 
by Nature Herself by Her Way of Attraction, without 
which Harmony Aesthetic and Magnetic thy Lion is 
silent, and inert, even as Achilles (before his Rage) in his 
Tent? Now also therefore I charge thee, o my Son, to 
partake constantly of this Sacrament, for it is proper to 
all Virtue, and as thou dost learn to use it in Perfection, 
thou wilt surpass all other Modes of Magick. Yea, in 
good sooth, no Herb or Potion is like unto this, supreme 
in every Case, for it is the True Stone of the Philosophers, 
and the Elixir and Medicine of all Things, the Universal 
Tincture or Menstruum of Thine Own Will. 
95 
DE DISCIPULIS REGENDIS 
Iwill have thee to know, moreover, my dear Son, the 
right Art of Conduct with them whom I shall give thee 
for Initiation. And the Rule thereof is one Rule: Do what 
thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. See thou con-
stantly to it that this be not broken; especially in the 
Section thereof (I dare say so) which readeth Mind Thine 
Own Business. This is of Application equally to all, and 
the most dangerous Man (or Woman, as hath occurred, or 
I err) is the Busy-Body. Oh how ashamed are we, and 
moved to Indignation, seeing the Sins and Follies of our 
Neighbours ! Of all the Occasions of this Grievance the 
most common is the Desire of Sex unsatisfied; and thou 
knowest already, even in thy young Experience, how in 
that Delirium the Weal of the whole Universe appeareth 
of no account. Do thou then wean thy Babes from that 
Simplicity, and instil the sense of true Proportion. For 
verily this is a Way of Madness, Love, unless it be under 
Will. And the Cure of this Madness is not so good as its 
Prevention, so that thou shouldst be beforehand with 
these Children, shewing them the right Importance of 
Love, how it should be a sacred Rite, exalted above Per-
sonality, and a Fire to enlighten and serve Man, not to 
devour him. 
96 
DE QUIBUSDAM MORBIS DISCTPULORUM 
AND thus, if any Babe of thine be ill at ease, look closely 
first whether this Love be not the root of his Distem-
per. Watch also Idleness, for whoso presseth eagerly 
forward in Will heedeth little the Affairs of his Fellows. 
0 my Son, if every Man doth his own Will, there is no 
more to say! But the Busy-Body nor mindeth his awn 
Business, nor leaveth others to mind theirs. Be thou 
instant therefore with such an one, to cure him by enlight-
ening his Will, and speeding him therein. Remember 
also that if one speak ill of another, the Fault is first of all 
in himself, for we know naught but that which is within 
us. Did not the great Witch-Finder end by confessing 
that he also was a Sorcerer? We become that which 
obsesseth us, either through extreme Hate or extreme 
Love. Knowest thou not how the one is a Symbol of the 
other? For this reason, since Love is the Formula of 
Life, we are under Bond to assimilate (in the End) that 
which we fear or hate. So then we shall be wise to 
mould all Things within ourselves in Quietness and Mod-
ulation. But above all must we use all to our own End, 
adapting with Adroitness even our Weakness to the Work. 
97 
DE CULPIS DOMI PETENDIS 
THEREFORE, watch heedfully the Fault of another, 
that thou mayst correct it in thyself. For if it were 
not in thee, thou couldst not perceive it or understand it. 
Lo, in thine Ecstasy of Love, thou callest upon the Uni-
verse to bear Witness that to this End alone was it creat-
ed; it is unthinkable that thou shouldst love another, and 
incomprehensible that any Man should grieve. Yet ere 
the Moon change her Quarter, thou art free of thy Limes, 
and lovest another, and it may be grievest in thyself 
while he that amazed thee hath joined the Company of 
the Rejoicing. Watch then, and heed thyself; and pay no 
heed to thy Fellows, insofar as they impede thee not. And 
let this be the Rule. For every Will is pure, and every 
Orbit free; but Error bringeth Confusion. See therefore 
that none leave his Path, lest he foul that of his Brother; 
and remember also that with Speed cometh Ease of Con-
trol. Let each man therefore urge briskly his Chariot in 
a Right Line toward the Centre; for two Radii cannot 
cross. And beware most of this Love, because it lieth so 
close to Will that Dis-ease thereof easily imparteth his 
Error to the whole Way of the Magician. 
98 
DE CORPORE UMBRA HOMINIS 
CONCERNING the Aeon, o my Son, learn that the Sun 
and His Viceregent are in all Aeons, of necessity, 
Father, Centre, Creator, each in His Sphere of Operation. 
But the Formula of the past Aeon was of the Dying God, 
and was based upon Ignorance. For Men thought that the 
Sun died and was re-born, alike in the Day and in the 
Year; and so also was the Mystery of Man. Now already 
are we well assured by Science how the Death of the 
Sun is in truth but the Shifting of a Shadow; and in this 
Aeon (o my Son, I lift up my Voice and I make Proph-
ecy!) so shall it be proven as to Death. For the Body of 
Man is but his Shadow; it cometh and goeth even as the 
Tides of Ocean; and he only is in Darkness who is hidden 
by that Shadow from the Light of His True Self. Now 
therefore understand thou the Formula of Horus, the 
Lion God, the Child crowned and conquering that cometh 
forth in Force and Fire! For thy Changes are not Phases 
of Thee, but of the Phantoms which thou mistakest for 
thy Self. 
DE SIRENIS 
CONCERNING the Love of Women, o my Son, it is writ- 
ten in the Book of the Law that all is Freedom, if it 
be done unto Our Lady Nuit. Yet also there is this 
Consideration, that for every Parsifal there is a Kundry. 
Thou mayst eat a thousand Fruits of the Garden; but 
there is One Tree whose Name for thee is Poison. In 
every great Initiation is an Ordeal, wherein appeareth a 
Siren or Vampire appointed to destroy the Candidate. 
I have myself witnessed the Blasting of not less than ten 
of mine own Flowers, that I tended when I was NEMO, 
and that although I saw the Cankerworm, and knew it, 
and gave urgent Warning. Now then consider deeply 
in thyself if I were rightly governed in this Action, 
according to the Tao. For We that are Magicians work 
without Fear or Haste, being Omnipotent in Eternity, 
and each Star must go his Way; and who am I that I 
should save this People? "Wilt thou smite me, as thou 
smotest the Egyptian yesterday?" Yea, although mine 
were the Might to save these Ten, I reached not forth 
mine Arm against Iniquity. I spake and I was silent; 
and that which was appointed came to pass. As it is 
written: The Pregnant Goddess hath let down Her Bur-
den upon the Earth. 
100 
DE FEMINA QUADAM 
KNOWEST thou for what Cause I am moved to write 
this unto Thee, my Son only-begotten, Child of Mag-
ick and of Mystery? It is that I thy Father am also in 
this Ordeal of Initiation at this Hour. For the Sun is 
nigh unto the End of the Sign of the Fishes in the Thir-
teenth Year of the Aeon, and the New Current of High 
Magick leapeth forth as a Flood from the Womb of my 
True Lady BABALON. And a Word hath come to me 
by the Mouth of the Scarlet Woman whose Name is EVE, 
or AHITHA, concerning the Temple of JUPPITER that 
is builded for me. And therein is a Woman appointed 
to a certain Office. Now this Woman appeared to me in 
a Vision when I was in the House of the Juggler by the 
Lake among the Mountains, the Sun being in Cancer in 
the Eleventh Year of the Aeon, even in the Week after 
thy Birth. And I think this Woman to be her whom .1 
call WESRUN. But even while with a Pure Heart I did 
invoke Her, there came unto me another like unto her, 
so that I am confused in my Mind and bewildered. And 
this Other Woman stirreth my true Nature in its Depth, 
so that I will not call it Love. For the Voice of Love I 
know of old; but this Other Woman speaketh in a 
Tongue whereof I have no Understanding. 
101 
DE SUA VIRTUTE 
WHAT then shall I do herein? For the Scarlet 
Woman adjureth me by the Great Name of God 
ITHUPHALLOS that I deal with this Other Woman as 
with any Woman, according to my Will. But this I 
fear, for that she is not as any Woman, and I deem 
her to be the Vampire of this Ordeal How then? Shall 
I fear? Said I not once long since, when I was called of 
Men Eliphaz Levi Zahed, that the Error of Oedipus was 
that he should have tamed the Sphinx, and ridden her 
into Thebes? Shall I not take this Vampire, if she be 
such, and master her, and turn her to the great End? 
"Am I such a Man as should flee?" Is not all Fear the 
word of Failure? Shall I distrust my Destiny? Am I 
that am the Word of the Aeon of so little avail that even 
the whole Powers of Chorortzon can disperse me? Nay, 
o my Son, there is Courage of Ignorance and Discretion 
of Knowledge; but beyond these is Courage of Knowl-
edge, and by no less Virtue will I win through unto mine 
End. As it is written: with Courage conquering Fear 
will I approach Thee. Atungn. 
102 
DE ALIQUIBUS MODIS ORACULI PETENDI 
MY Son, in all Judgment and Decision is great Delicacy, 
but most in these Matters of the Will. For thou art 
Advocate as well as Judge, and unless thou have well 
organized thy Mind thou art Bondslave of Prejudice. For 
this Cause is it adjuvant to thy Wisdom to call Witnesses 
that are not of thine own Nature, and to ask Oracles 
whose Interpretation is bound by Fixed Rule. This is the 
Use of the Book TAROT, of the Divination by Earth, or 
by the other Elements, or by the Book Yi King, and many 
another Mode of Truth. Thou lmowest by thine Expe-
rience that these Arts deceive Thee not, save insofar as 
thou deceivest thyself. So then to thee that art NEMO 
is no Siege Perilous at this Table, but to them that are 
yet below the Abyss is very notable Danger of Error. Yet 
must they train themselves constantly in these Modes, 
for Experience itself shall teach them how their Bias 
toward their Desires reacteth in the End against them-
selves, and hindereth them in the Execution of their Wills. 
Nevertheless, as thou well knowest, the best Mode is the 
Creation of an Intelligible Image by Virtue of the Mass 
of the Holy Ghost, declaring the True Will unto thee in 
Terms of thy Qabalah! 
103 
DE FRATRIBUS NIGHTS, FILIIS INIQUITATIS 
eiF the Black Brothers, o my Son, will I write these 
Things following. I have told thee already concern-
ing Change, how it is the Law, because every Change 
is an Act of Love under Will. So then he that is Adept 
Exempt, whether in Our Holy Order or another, may not 
remain in the Pillar of Mercy, because it is not balanced, 
but is unstable. Therefore is the Choice given unto him, 
whether he will destroy his Temple, and give up his Life, 
extending it to Universal Life, or whether he will make 
a Fortress about that Temple, and abide therein, in the 
false Sphere of Daath, which is in the Abyss. And to the 
Adepts of Our Holy Order this Choice is terrible, by 
Cause that they must abandon even Him whose Knowl-
edge and Conversation they have attained. Yet, o my 
Son, they have much Help of Our Order in this Aeon, 
because the General Formula is Love, so that their Habit 
itself urgeth them to the Bed of Our Lady BABALON. 
Know then the Black Brothers by these True Signs of 
their Initiation of Iniquity, that they resist Change, res-
trict and deny Love, fear Death. Percutiantur. 
104 
DE VIRTUTE CHIRURGICA 
KNOW that the Cult of the Slave-gods is a Device of 
those Black Brothers. All that stagnateth is thereof, 
and thence cometh not Stability, but Putrefaction. En-
dure not thou the static Standards: nay, neither in 
Thought nor in Action. Resist not even the Change that 
is the Rottenness of Choronzon, but rather speed it, 
so that the Elements may combine by Love under Will. 
Aumgn. Since the Black Brothers and their Cults set 
themselves against Change, do thou break them asunder. 
Yea, though of bad come worse, continue in that Way; 
for it is as if thou didst open an Abscess, the first Effect 
being noisome exceedingly, but the last Cleanness. Heed 
not then whoso crieth Anarchy, and Immorality, and 
Heresy against thee, and feareth to destroy Abuse lest 
worse Things come of it. For the Will of the Universe in 
its Wholeness is to Truth, and thou dost well to purge it 
from its Costiveness. For it is written that there is no 
Bond that can unite the divided but Love, so that only 
those Complexes which are in truth Simplicities, being 
built Cell by Cell into an Unity by Virtue of Love under 
Will, are worthy to endure in their Progression. 
105 
DE OPERIBUS STELLAE MICROCOSMI, QUORUM 
SUNT QUATTUOR MINORES 
Ihave already written unto thee, o my Son, of the Para- 
dox of Liberty, how the Freedom of thy Will depen-
deth upon the Bending of all thy Forces to that one End. 
But now learn also how great is the (Economy of our 
Magick, and this will I declare unto thee in a Figure of 
the Holy Qabalah, to wit, the Formula of the Tetragram-
maton. Firstly, the Effect of the Operation of Yod and 
He is not Vau only, but with Vau appeareth also a new 
He, as a By-Product, and She is mysterious, being at once 
the Flower of the Three Others, and their Poison. Now 
by the Operation of Vau upon that He is no new Creation, 
but the Daughter is set upon the Throne of Her Mother, 
and by this is rekindled the Fire of Yod, which, consum-
ing that Virgin, doth not add a Fifth Person, but bal-
anceth and perfecteth all. For this Shin, that is the Holy 
Spirit, pervadeth these, and is immanent. Thus in Three 
Operations is the Pentagram formulated. But in the 
Figure of that Star these Operations are not indicated, 
for the five Lines of Force connect not according to any 
of them; but Five New Operations are made possible; 
and these are the Works proper to the perfected Man. 
Firstly, the Work which lieth level, the Vau with the He, 
is of the Yang and the Yin, and maketh One the Human 
with the Divine, as in the Attainment of the Master of 
the Temple. Yet this Work hath his Perversion, which 
is of Daath. Thus then for these Four Works, they pertain 
all to the Natural Formula of the Cross and Rose. 
106 
DE OPERIBUS STELLAE MICROCOSMI 
QUORUM SUNT QUATTIJOR MAJORES 
omy Son, behold now the Mystery and Virtue of the 
Silver Star! For of these Four Works not One leadeth 
to the Crown, because Tetragrammaton hath His Root 
only in Chokmah. So therefore the Formula of the Rosy 
Cross availeth no more in the Highest. Now then in the 
Pentagram are Two Lines that invoke Spirit, though they 
lead not thereunto, and they are the Works of He with 
He, and of Yod with Vau. Of these twain the former is 
a Work Magical of the Nature of Musick, and it draweth 
down the Fire of the Higher by Seduction or Bewitch-
ment. Shall I say Enchantment? Shall I say Incantation? 
It is Song. But Bewitchment is a Work opposite thereun-
to, whose Effect formulateth itself by direct Creation in 
the Sphere of its Purpose and Intent. But there remain 
yet Two of the Eight Works, namely the straight Aspira-
tion of the Chiah or Creator in thee to the Crown, and the 
Surrender of the Nephesch or Animal Soul to the Posses-
sion thereof; and these be the twin geodesic Formulae 
of the Final Attainment, being Archetypes of the Paths of 
Magick (the one) and Mysticism (the other) unto the End. 
From each of these Eight Works is derived a separate 
Mode of practical Use, each after his Kind; and it should 
be well for thine Instruction if thou study upon these my 
Words, and found upon them a System. 0 my Son, forget 
not the Arcanum of their Balance and Proportion; for 
herein lieth the Mystery of their Holiness. 
107 
DE STELLA MACROCOSM' 
THUS far then concerning the Pentagram, how it is of 
the Cross, and its Virtue in the Highest; but the Hexa-
gram is for the most Part a Detail of the Formula of the 
Rose and Cross. Already have I shewed unto thee how 
the Most Holy Trinity is the Yang; but the Spirit, and 
the Water (or Fluid) and the Blood, that bear witness in 
the Inferior, are of the Yin. Thus the Operation of the 
Hexagram lieth wholly within the Order of one Plane, 
uniting indeed any Soul with its Image, but not transcen-
dentally, for its Effect is Cosmos, the Vau that springeth 
from the Union of the Yod and the He. Thus it is but• a 
Glyph only of that first Formula, not of the others. But 
of all these Things shalt thou thyself make study with 
ardent Affection; for therein lie many mysteries of Prac-
tical Wisdom in our Magick Art. And this is the Wonder 
and Beauty of this Work, that for every Man is his own 
Palace. Yea, this is Life, that the Secrets of Our Order 
are not fixed and dead, as are the Formulae of the Outer. 
Know that in the many thousand Times that I have per-
formed the Ritual of the Pentagram, or the Invocation 
of the Heart girt with a Serpent, or the Mass of the 
Phoenix, or of the Holy Ghost, there has not been one 
time wherein I did not win new Light, or Knowledge, 
or Power, or Virtue, save through mine own Weakness 
or Error. 
108 
DE SUA FEMINA OLUN, ET DE ECSTASIA 
PRAETER OMNIA SUBSTANTI 
MY Son, I am enflamed with Love. I burn up eagerly 
in the Passion that thus mightily consumeth me. Yet 
in myself I know not at all That which constraineth me. 
It is Nuit herself invisibly that embraceth me, and en-
kindleth my Soul in Ecstasy. There is Silence in my Soul, 
and the Fear round about me, as I were Syrinx in the 
Night of the Forest. This is a great Mystery that I endure, 
a Mystery too great for the mortal Part of me. For but 
now, when I cried out upon the Name Olun which is the 
secret Name of my Lady that hath come to me — most 
strangely! — then was I rapt away altogether subtly 
yet fiercely into a Trance that hath transformed me 
with Attainment, yet without Trace in Mind. Oh my 
Son! there is the Transfiguration of Glory, and there 
is the Jewel in the Lotus Flower; yea, also is many 
another whereof I am Partaker. But this last Passion, 
that my Lady Olun hath brought unto me upon this 
last Day of the Winter of the Thirteenth Year of the Aeon, 
even as I wrote these Words unto thee, is a Mystery of 
Mysteries beyond all these. Oh my Son, thou knowest 
well the Perils and the Profit of Our Path; continue thou 
therein. Olun! MAPIE! BABALON! Adsum. 
109 
DE NOMINE OLUN 
FOUR Seasons, or it may be nigh five, that are past, I 
thy Father was in the City called New Orleans, and 
being in Travail of Spirit I did invoke the God that giveth 
Wisdom, bearing the Word of the All-Father by his Cadu-
ceus. Then, suddenly, as I began, came (as it were a Gust 
of Fire whirled forth against that Idea) the Wit of Mine 
Utter Identity, so that I ceased, crying Mercurius Sum. 
Also instantly I knew in myself that there was a Mys-
tery therein hidden, and, translating into the Greek 
Tongue, I exclaimed 'EPMHE 'EIMI, whose numeration 
did I makP in my Mind forthwith and it is Four Hundred 
and Eighteen, like unto the Word of the Aeon. So by this 
I knew that my Work was well wrought in Truth. Thus 
then also was it with this my Lady; for after many Ques-
tions I obtained from the Wizard Amalantrah that Name 
Olun, that is One Hundred and Fifty and Six even as that 
of Our Lady BABALON; and then, being inspired, I wrote 
down her earthname in Greek, MAPIE, which is also that 
same most Holy Number. I will have thee to wit also that 
this Name (as I have learned) is in the Phoenician Tongue 
whOlon; which by Interpretation is That which is Infinite, 
and Space; so that all is consonant rightly with Nuit 
Our Lady of the Stars. Thus, oh my Son, is the Word of 
Truth echoed throughout all Worlds; and thus have the 
Wise mighty Assurance in Their Way. See, oh my Son, 
that thou work not without this Guard inflexible, lest 
thou err in thy Perceptions. 
110 
DE VIRIS MAGNANIMIS, AMORE 
PRAECLARISSIMIS 
KNOW that in the Mind of Man is much Wisdom that 
is hidden, being the Treasure of his Sire that he inher-
iteth. Thus, nigh all of his Moral Nature is unknown to 
him until his Puberty; that is, this Nature pertaineth not 
unto the Recording arid Judging Apparatus of his Brain 
until it is put therein by the Stirring of that deeper Nature 
within him. Thou wilt mark also that great Men are com-
monly great Lovers; and this is in Part because of their 
general Exuberance of Energy, but in Part also because 
(consciously or not) they are ware of this Secret following, 
that every Act of Love communicateth somewhat of the 
Wisdom stored within him to his Percipient Mind. Yet 
must such Act be done rightly, iccording to Art; and un-
less such Act is of Profit alike to Mind and Body, it is an 
Error. This then is true Doctrine; which, if it be under-
standed aright of thee, shall make diamond-clear thy Path 
in Love, which (to them that know not this) is so obscure 
and perilous that I believe there is not one Man in Ten 
Thousand that cometh not to Misadventure therein. 
111 
DE CASTITATE 
MY Son, be fervent! Be firm! Be stable! Be quick to mark 
Impurity, how one Course of Ideas seeketh to infringe 
upon another, to quell the Virtue thereof. Gold is pure, 
but to drink molten Gold were Impurity to thy Body, and 
its Destruction. Law is a Code of the Customs of a People; 
if it intrude thereon to alter them, it is an Impurity of 
Oppression. So also Diet is to be in Accord with Digestion; 
Ethics were an Impurity therein. Love is an Expression 
of the Will of the Body, yea, and more also, of That which 
created the Body -  and its Operation is commonly between 
One and One, so that the Interference of any Third Per-
son is Impurity, and not to be endured. Nay, even the 
Thought of a Third Person hath by Ordinary no part in 
Love; so that, as thou seest constantly in thy Life, Love, 
being strong, taketh no heed of others, and 'some after-
Interference bringeth Misfortune. Now then shall We 
therefore cast out Love, or accept Impurity therein? God 
forbid. And for this Cause see thou well to .1t,that in thy 
Kingdom there be no Interference therewith, nor Hin-
drance from any. For it is perfect in itself. 
112 
DE CEREMONIO EQUINOXI 
MY Son, our Father in Heaven hath passed into the Sign 
of the Ram. It is Spring. I have performed the Rite 
of Union with Him according to the Antient Manner, and 
I know the Word that shall rule the Semester. Also it is 
given unto my Spirit to write unto thee concerning the 
Virtue of this Rite, and many another, of Antiquity. And 
it is this, that our Forefathers made of these Ceremonies 
an Epitome mnemonic, wherein certain Truth, or True 
Relation, should be communicated in a magical Manner. 
Now therefore by the Practice of these mayst thou awak-
en thy Wisdom, that it may manifest in thy Conscious 
Mind. And this Way is of Use even when the Ceremonies, 
as those of the Christians, are corrupt and deformed; but 
in such a Case thou shalt seek out the true antient Signi-
ficance thereof. For there is That within thee which re-
membereth Truth, and is ready to communicate the same 
unto thee when thou hast Wit to evoke it from the Ady-
tum and Sanctuary of thy Being. And this is to be done 
by this Repetition of the Formulm of that Truth. Note 
thou further that this which I tell thee is the Defence of 
Formalism; and indeed thou must work upon a certain 
Skeleton, but clothe it with live Flesh. 
113 
DE LICE STELLARUM 
JT was that most holy Prophet, thine Uncle, called upon 
Earth William O'Neill, or Blake, who wrote for our 
Understanding these Eleven sacred Words: 
If the Sun and Moon should doubt 
They'd immediately go out. 
0 my Son, our Work is to shine by Force and Virtue 
of our own Natures without Consciousness or Considera-
tion. Now, notwithstanding that our Radiance is constant 
and undimmed, it may be that Clouds gathering about 
us conceal our Glory from the Vision of other Stars. These 
Clouds are our Thoughts; not those true Thoughts which 
are but conscious Expressions of our Will, such as man-
ifest in our Poesy, or our Music, or other Flower-Ray 
of our Light quintessential. Nay, the Cloud-Thought is 
born of Division and of Doubt; for all Thoughts, except 
they be creative Emanations, are Witnesses to Conflict 
within us. Our settled Relations with the Universe do not 
disturb our Minds, as, by Example, our automatic bodily 
Functions, which speak to us only in the Sign of Distress. 
Thus all Consideration is Demonstration of Doubt; Doubt 
postulateth Duality, which is the Root of Choronzon. 
114 
DE CANTU 
So then, o my Son, here is my Wisdom, that the Voice 
of the Soul in its true Nature Eternal and Unchangea-
ble, comprehending All, is Silence; and the Voice of the 
Soul, dynamic, in the Way of its Will, is Song. Nor is there 
any Form of Utterance that is not, as Song is, the Music 
proper to that Motion, according to the Law. Thus, as 
thy Cousin Arthur Machen hath rejoiced to make plain 
unto Men in his Book called Hieroglyphics, the first Qual-
ity of Art is its Ecstasy. So, to nigh all Men at one 
Time or other, cometh Joy of Creation, with the Belief 
that their Utterance is holy and be-utiful, glorious with 
Banners. This would indeed be the Case, an we could 
discern their Thought from their Words; but because they 
have no technical Skill to express themselves, they do 
not enable others to reproduce or re-create the original 
Passion which inspired them, or even any Memory there-
of. Understand then what is the Agony of the Great 
Soul, who hath every Key of Paradise at his Girdle, when 
he would open the Gate of Holiness, or of Beauty, or of 
any Virtue soever, to the Men of his Age! 
115 
DE STULTITIA HUMANA 
KNOW that a Mind can apprehend only those Things 
a  with which it is already familiar, at least in Part. 
Moreover, it will ever interpret according to the Distor-
tion of its own Lenses. Thus, in a great War, all Speech 
soever may be understood as if it were of Reference 
thereunto; also, a Guilty Person, or a Melancholic, may 
see in every Stranger an Officer of Justice, or one of 
them that are banded together (him seemeth) to perse-
cute him, as the Case may be. But consider moreover 
that the Mysterious is ever the Terrible, for Vulgar 
Minds. How then when a New Word is spoken? Either 
it is not heard, or it is understood awry; and it evoketh 
Fear, and Hate as a Reaction against Fear. Then Men 
take him and set him at naught, and spit upon him, and 
scourge him, and lead him away to crucify him; and the 
third Day he riseth from among the dead, and ascendeth 
into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God, and 
cometh to judge the Quick and the Dead. This, o my 
Son, is the History of Everyman unto whom is given a 
Word. 
116 
DE SUO PROELIO 
NOW therefore thou seest how Men take the Scn of 
Science, and burn him for a Sorcerer or a Heretic; 
the Poet, and cast him out as Reprobate; the Painter, as 
deforming Nature; the Musician, as denying Harmony; 
and so for every New Word. How much more, then, if 
the Word be of Universal Import; a Word of Revolution, 
and of Revelation in the Deep of the Soul? A new Star: 
that is for the Astronomers, and maybe setteth them by 
the Ears But a new Sun! That were for all Men, and 
a Seed of Tumult and Upheaval in every Land. Consider 
in thyself, therefore, what is the Might of the Adepts, 
the Energy of the Sanctuary, that can endow one Man 
with the Word of an Aeon, and bring him to the end 
in Victory, with his Chariot wreathed in Flowers, and 
his Head bound round with a Fillet of blood-honoured 
Laurel! My Son, thou art entered into the Battle; and 
the Men of our Race and of our Clan return not save 
in Glory. 
117 
DE NECESSITATE VERBI CLAMANDI 
HE that striveth against his own Nature is witless; he 
wotteth not his Will, darkening Counsel in himself, 
denying his own God, and giving place to Choronzon. So 
then his Work becometh Hotchpot, and he is shattered 
and dispersed in the Abyss. Nor is it better for him if 
he do this for the supposed Good of another; yea, for 
that other is it Evil also in the End of the Matter. For 
to manifest thine own Division to another, and to deceive 
him, is but to confirm him in Blindness, or Illusion, and 
to hinder or to deflect him in his Way. Now to do thine 
own Will is to leave him free to do his own Will; but 
to mask thy Will is to falsify one of the Beacons by 
which he may steer his Ship. My Son, all Division of 
Soul, that begetteth Nerve-storm and Insanity, cometh 
from wrong Adjustment to Reality, and to Fear thereof. 
Wilt thou then hide Truth from thy Brother, lest he 
suffer? Thou dost not well, but confirmest him in Iniq-
uity, and in Illusion, and in Infirmity of Spirit. 
118 
DE MYSTERIO EUCHARISTICO UNIVERSAL' 
MY Son, heed also this Word of thine Uncle William 
n  O'Neill: Everything that lives is holy. Yea, and more 
also, every Act is holy, being essential to the Universal 
Sacrament Knowing this, thou mayest conform with 
that which is written in the Book of the Law: to make 
no distinction between any one Thing and any other 
Thing. Learn well to apprehend this Mystery, for it is 
the Great Gate of the College of Understanding, whereby 
each and all of thy Senses become constant and perpetual 
Witnesses of the One Eucharist, whereunto also they are 
Ministers. So then to thee every Phenomenon soever is 
the Body of Nuit in Her Passion; for it is an Event: that 
is, the Marriage of some one Point of View with some 
One Possibility. And this State of Mind is notably an 
Appurtenance of thy Grade of Master of the Temple, 
and the Unveiling of the Arcanum of Sorrow, which is 
thy Work, as it is written in Liber Magi. Moreover, this 
State, assimilated in the very Marrow of thy Mind, is 
the first Step toward the Comprehension of the Arcanum 
of Change, which is the Root of the Work of a Magus of 
Our Holy Order. 0 my Son, bind this within thine Heart, 
for its Name is the Beatific Vision. 
119 
DE RECTO IN RECTO 
NOW also then I bid thee use all filial Diligence, and 
attend to this same Word in the Mouth of thine Ear-
liest Ancestor (except we adventure to invoke the Name 
FU-HSI) in our known Genealogy, the Most Holy, the 
True Man, Lao-tze, that gave His Light unto the King-
dom of Flowers. For being questioned concerning the 
Abode of the TAO, he gave Answer that It was in the 
Dung. Again, the Tathagata, the Buddha, most blessed, 
most perfect, and most enlightened, added his Voice, that 
there is no Grain of Dust which shall not attain to be 
Arhan. Keep therefore in just Balance the Relation of 
Illusion to Illusion in that Aspect of Illusion, neither con-
fusing the Planes, nor confounding the Stars, nor de-
nying the Laws of their Reaction, yet with Eagle's Vision 
beholding the One Sun of the True Nature of the Whole. 
Verily, this is the Truth, and unto it did also Dionysus 
and Tahuti and Sri Krishna set the Seal of their Witness. 
Cleanse therefore thine Heart, o my Son, in the Waters 
of the Great Sea, and enkindle it with the Fire of the 
Holy Ghost. For this is His Peculiar Work of Sanctifi-
cation. 
120 
DE VIRGINE BEATA 
UNDERSTAND then well this Mystery of Universal 
Godliness; for it is the Naked Beauty of the Virgin 
of the World. Lo! since the End is Perfection, as I have 
already shewn unto thee, and since also every Event is 
inexorably and ineluctably interwoven in the Web of that 
Fate, it is certain that every Phenomenon is (as thou art 
sworn to understand) "a particular Dealing of God with 
thy Soul." Yea, and more also, it is a necessary Rubric 
in this Ritual of Perfection. Turn not therefore away 
thine Eyes, for that they are too pure to behold Evil; 
but look upon Evil with Joy, comprehending it in the 
Fervour of this Light that I have enkindled in thy Mind. 
Learn also that every Thing soever is Evil, if thou con-
sider it as apart, static, and in Division; and thus in a 
Degree must thou apprehend the Mystery of Change 
for it is by Virtue of Change that this Truth of Beauty 
and Holiness is made steadfast in the Universe. 0 my 
Son, there is no Delight sweeter than the continuous Con-
templation of this Marvel and Pageant that is ever about 
thee; it is the Beatitude of the Beatitudes. 
121 
DE JOCO SUAE MOECHAE 
RESIST not Change, therefore, but act constantly accord- 
ing to thy true Nature. For here only thou standest 
in Sorrow, if there be a Division conscious of itself, and 
hindered from its Way (whose Name is Love) unto its 
Dissolution. It is written in the Book of the Law that 
the Pain of Division is as nothing, and the Joy of Dis-
solution all. Now then here is an Art and Device of 
Magick that I will declare unto thee, albeit it is a Peril 
if thou be not fixed in that Truth, and in that Beatific 
Vision whereof I have written in the three Chapters fore-
going. And it is this, to create by Artifice a Conflict 
in thyself, that thou mayst take thy Pleasure in its Re-
solution. Of this Play is thy sweet Stepmother, my Con-
cubine, the Holy and Adulterous Olun, sublimely Mis-
tress; for she in.voketh in her Fancy a thousand Obstacles 
to Love, so thkt she shuddereth at a Touch, swooneth at 
a Kiss, and suffereth Death and Hell in the Ecstasy of 
her Body. And this is her Art, and it is of Nuit Our 
Lady, for it is a Drama or Commemoration of the whole 
Mystery of By-coming. 
122 
DE PERICULO JOCORUM AMORIS 
yET be thou heedful, o my Son, for this Art is set upon 
a Razor's Edge. In our Blood is this Great Pox of Sin, 
whose Word is Restriction, as Inheritance of our Sires 
that served the Slave-Gods. Thou must be free in the 
Law of Thelema, perfectly one with thy True Self, sin-
gly and wholly bound in thy true Will, before thou durst 
(in Prudence) invoke the Name of Choronzon, even for 
thy good Sport and Phantasy. It is but to pretend, thou 
sayest; and that is sooth; yet thou must make Pretence 
so well as to deceive thyself, albeit for a Moment, else 
were thy Sport savourless. Then, an thou have one Point 
of Weakness in thee, that Thought of thine may incar-
nate, and destroy thee Verily, the wise Enchanter is 
sure beyond Doubt of his Charm ere he toy with a fang-
ed Cobra; and thou well knowest that this Peril of Di-
vision in Thy Self is the only one that can touch thee. 
For all other Evil is but Elaboration of this Theme of 
Choronzon. Praise therefore thy sweet Stepmother, my 
Concubine, the Holy and Adulterous Olup; and thine own 
Mother Hilarion, for in this Art was she also pre-eminent. 
123 
DE LIBIDINE SECRETA 
TT is said among Men that the word Hell deriveth from 
the Verb helan, to hele or conceal, in the Tongue of 
the Anglo-Saxons. That is, it is the Concealed Place; 
and this, since all things are in thine own Self, is the 
Unconscious. How then? Because Men were already 
aware how this Unconscious, or Libido, is opposed, for 
the most part, to the Conscious Will. In the Slave-Ages 
this is a Truth Universal, or well nigh to it; for in such 
Times are Men compelled to Uniformity by the Cons-
traint of Necessity herself. Yea, of old it was a contin-
ual Siege of every Man, of every Clan, of every Envi-
ronment; and to relax Guard was then Self-Murder, or 
else Treachery. So then no Man might choose his Way, 
until he were Hunter, Fighter, Builder; nor any Woman, 
but she must first be Breeder. Now in the Growth of 
States by Organization came, stealthily stepping, a cer-
tain Security against the grossest Perils, so that a few 
Men could be spared from Toil to cultivate Wisdom; 
and this was first provided by the Selection of a Caste 
Pontifical. By this Device came the Alliance of King and 
Priest, Strength and Cunning fortifying each the other 
through the Division of Labour. 
124 
DE ORDINE CIVITATUM 
S° presently, o my Son, this first Organization among 
Men, by a Procedure parallel to that of the Differen-
tiation of Protoplasm, made the State competent to ex-
plore and to control Nature; and every Profit of this Sort 
released more Energy, and enlarged the Class of the 
Learned, until, as it is this Day, only a small Proportion 
of any Man's Work must needs go to the Satisfaction of 
the first Will essential and common, the Provision of 
Shelter, Food, and Protection. Verily also thou seest 
many Women made free to live as they will, even to the 
Admiration and Delight of the Sage whose Eye laugheth 
to contemplate Mischief. Thus the Duty of every Unit 
toward the Whole is diminished, and also the Necessity 
to conform with those narrow Laws which preserve 
primitive Tribes in their Struggle against Environment. 
Thus the State need suppress only such Heresies as di-
rectly threaten its political Stability, only such Modes 
of Life as work manifest and proven Hurt to others, or 
cause general Disorder by their Scandal. Therefore, save 
and except he interfere thereby with the Root Laws of 
the Common Weal, a Man is free to develop as he will 
according to his True Nature. 
125 
DE SCIENTIAE MODO 
TO the Mind of the Philosopher, therefore, in the 
Youth of an Age, any Variation in Type must appear 
as a Disaster; yea, verily, Intelligence itself must per-
force prove its Value to the Brute in Terms of Brutishness 
or he distrusteth and destroyeth it. Not withstanding, 
as thou knowest, that Variation which is fitted to his 
Environment is proven the Salvation of the Species. 
Only, among Men, his Fellows turn ever upon the Sav-
iour, and rend him, until those who follow him in secret, 
and it may be unconsciously, prove their Virtue and his 
Wisdom by their Survival when his Persecutors perish 
in their Folly. But we, being secure against all primary 
Enemies to the individual or the common Weal, may, 
nay, we must, if we would attain the Summit for our 
Race, devote all spare Leisure, Wealth, and Energy 
to the Creation of Variation from the Norm, and thus 
by clear Knowledge bought of Experiment and of Expe-
rience, move with Eyes well open upon our True Path. 
So therefore Our Law of Thelema is justified also of 
Biology and of Social Science. It is the True Way of 
Nature, the Right Strategy in the War of Man with his 
Environment; it is the Life of his Soul. 
126 
DE MONSTRIS 
QAYEST thou, o my Son, that not thus, but by forced 
" Training, one cometh to Perfection? This indeed is 
sooth, that by artificial Selection, and well-watched 
Growth and Environment, one hath Dogs, Horses, Pig-
eons, and the like, which excel their Forebears in 
Strength, in Beauty, in Speed, as one will. Yet is this 
Work but a false Magical Artifice, temporary and of 
Illusion; for thy Masterpieces are but Monsters, not True 
Variations, and if thou leave them, they revert swiftly 
to their own proper and authentic Type, because that 
Type was made fit by Experience to its Environment. 
So therefore every Variation must be left free to per-
petuate itself or to perish, not cherished for its Beauty, 
not guarded for its Appeal to thine Ideal, not cut off 
in thy Fear thereof. For the Proof of its Virtue lieth 
in the Manifestation of its Power to survive; Amen, to 
reproduce itself after its Kind. Nurse not the Weakness 
of any Man, nor swaddle and cosset him, nay, not though 
he were Poet or Artist, because of his Value to thy Fancy; 
for if thou do this, he shall increase in his Infirmity, so 
that even his Work, for which thou lovest him, shall be 
enfeebled also. 
127 
DE INFERNO PALATIO SAPIENTIAE 
NOW then thou seest that this Hell, or Concealed Place 
within thee, is no more a Fear or Hindrance to Men 
of a Free Race, but the Treasure-House of the Assimilated 
Wisdom of the Ages, and the Knowledge of the True Way. 
Thus are we Just and Wise to discover this Secret in our-
selves, and conform the conscious Mind therewith. For 
that Mind is compact solely (until it be illuminated) of 
Impressions and Judgments, so that its Will is but di-
rected by the Sum of the shallow Reactions of a most 
limited Experience. But thy True Will is the Wisdom of 
the Ages of thy Generations, the Expression of that which 
bath fitted thee to thine Environment. Thus thy cons-
cious Mind is often times foolish, as when thou admirest 
an Ideal, and wouldst attain it, but thy true Will letteth 
thee, so that there is Conflict, and the Humiliation of that 
Mind. Here will I call to Witness the common Event of 
"Good Resolutions" that defy the Lightning of Destiny, 
being puffed up by the Wind of an Indigestible Ideal 
putrefying within thee. Thence cometh Colic, and pres-
er tly the Poison is expelled, or else thou diest. tut Res-
olutions of True Will are mighty against Circumstance. 
128 
DE VITIIS VOLUNTATIS SECRETAE 
"LEARN moreover concerning this Hell, or Hidden Wis- 
dom, that is within thee, that it is modified, little by 
little, through the Experience of the Conscious Mind, 
which feedeth it. For that Wisdom is the Expression, or 
rather Symbol and Hieroglyph, of the true Adjustment 
of thy Being to its Environment. Now then, that Envi-
ronment being eroded by Time, this Wisdom is no more 
perfect, for it is not Absolute, but standeth in Relation 
to the Universe. So then a Part thereof may become 
void of use, and atrophy, as (I will instance this Case) 
Man's Wit of Smell; and the bodily Organ corresponding 
degenerateth therewith. But this is an Effect of much 
Time, so that in thine Hell thou art like to find Elements 
vain, or foolish, or contrary to thy present Weal. Yet, 
o my Son, this Hidden Wisdom is not thy True Will, 
but only the Levers (I may say so) thereof. Notwith-
standing, there lieth therein a Faculty of Balance, where-
by it is able to judge whether any Element in itself 
is presently useful and benign, or else idle and malignant. 
Here then is a Root of Conflict between the Conscious 
and the Unconscious, here is a Debate concerning the 
right Order of Conduct, how the Will may be accom-
plished. 
129 
DE RATIONE PRAESIDIO VOLUNTATIS 
o 	my Son, in this Case is there Darkness, yet this Com- 
fort as a Lamp therein, that there is no Error in the 
Will, but only Doubt as to the Means of Success, else were 
we as Children afeared of Night. Thus we have need of 
naught but to consider the Matter by Wit of Reason, and 
of Prudence, and of Common Sense, and of Experience, 
and of Science, adjusting ourselves so far as we may. Here 
is the Key of Sucess, and its Name is the Skill to make 
right Use of Circumstance. This then is the Virtue of 
the Mind, to be the Wazir of the Will, a true Counsellor, 
through Intelligence of the Universe. But, o my Son, do 
thou lay this Word beneath thine Heart, that the Mind 
hath no Will, nor Right thereto, so that Usurpation bring-
eth forth a fatal Conflict in thyself. For the Mind is 
sensitive, unstable as Air, and may be led foolishly in 
Leash by a stronger Mind that worketh as the cunning 
Tool of a Will. Therefore thy Safety and Defence is to 
hold thy Mind to his right Function, a faithful Minister 
to thine own True Will, that is King of that Star whose 
name is Thy Self, by Election of Nature. Heed well this, 
o my Son, for thy Mind Passive is rightly a Mirror to 
reflect all Things clearly without Prejudice, and to re-
main unstained by them. 
130 
DE CURSU SAPIENTIS 
THEREFORE consider this again in a Figure, that thy 
Mind is as the Marshal of an Army, to observe the 
Dispositions of the Enemy, and to order his own Forces 
rightly, according to that Information; but he hath no 
Will, only Obedience to the Word of his King to outwit 
and to overcome the Opposite. Nor doth that King make 
War by his own Whim, if he be wise and true, but solely 
because of the Necessity of his Country, and its Nature, 
whereof he is but Executive Officer and Interpreter, its 
Voice as the Marshal is its Arm. Thus then do thou un-
derstand thyself, not giving Place to thy Mind to dispute 
thy Will, nor through Ignorance and Carelessness allow-
ing the Enemy to deceive thee, nor by Fear, by Impru-
dence and Foolhardiness, by Hesitation and Vacillation, 
by Disorder and the Lack of Finn Correctness, by Failure 
in Elasticity or in Obstinacy, each at its Moment, suffer-
ing Defeat in the Hour of Shock. So then, o my Son, this 
is thy Work, to know the Word of thy Will without Error, 
and to make perfect every Faculty of thy Mind, in right 
Order and Readiness to impose that Word as Law upon 
the Universe. So mote it be! 
131 
DE RATIONE, QUAE SINE VOLUNTATE 
EST EONS MANIAE 
IS it not a Marvel how he that worketh with his Will, 
and is in constant Touch with the Reality external, 
maketh his Mind to serve him? How eagerly runneth it 
and returneth, gathering, arranging, clarifying, classify-
ing, organizing, comparing, setting in array, with Skill 
and Might and Energy that faileth never! Nay, my Son, 
in this Way thou canst be pitiless with thy Mind, and it 
will not rebel against thee, or neglect thine Ordinance. 
But now consider him that worketh not with his Will, 
how his Mind is Idle, not reaching out after Reality, but 
debating within itself of its own Affairs, like a Democ-
racy, introspective. Then this Mind, not reacting equably 
and with Elasticity to the World, is lost in its own Anar-
chy and Civil War, so that although it work not, it is 
overcome by Weakness of Division, and becometh Cho-
ronzon. And unto these Words I call to my Witness the 
Madness of the Soul of Muscovy, in this Year XIII of 
our Aeon that is ended. Therefore behold how this our 
Law of Thelema, Do what thou wilt, is the first founda-
tion of Health, whether in the Body, or the Mind, either 
of a simple or a complex, Organism. 
132 
DE VERITATE QUM FEMINAE NON 
DICERE LICET 
MY Son, I charge thee, howsoever thou beest provoked 
thereunto, tell not the Truth to any Woman. For 
this is that which is written: Cast not thy Pearls before 
Swine, lest they turn again and rend thee. Behold, in the 
Nature of Woman is no Truth, nor Apprehension of Truth, 
nor Possibility of Truth; only, if thou entrust this Jewel 
unto them, they forthwith use it to thy Loss and Destruc-
tion. But they are ware of thine own Love of Truth, and 
thy Respect thereunto; so therefore they tempt thee, flat-
tering with their Lips, that thou betray thyself to them. 
And they feign falsely, with every Wile, and cast about 
for thy Soul, until either in Love, or in Wrath, or in some 
other Folly thereof, thou speak Truth, profaning thy Sanc-
tuary. So was it ever, and herein I call to my Witness 
Samson of Timnath, that was lost by this Error. Wow 
for any Woman any Lie sufficeth; and think not in thine 
Extremity that Truth is mighty, and shall prevail, as it 
doth with any Man; for with a Woman her whole Craft 
and Device is to persuade thee of this, so that thou utter 
the Secret of thy Soul, and become her Prey. But so 
long as thou nourish her with her own Food of Falsity, 
thou art secure. 
133 
DE NATURA FEMINAE 
THE Nature of Woman, o my Son, is as thou hast learn- 
ed in Our most holy Qabalah; and She is the Cloth-
ing in Sex of Man, the Magical Image of his Will to Love. 
Therefore was it said by thine Uncle Wolfgang von Goe-
the: Das Ewigweibliche zieht uns hinan. But therefore 
also hath she no Nature of Truth, because she is but the 
Eidolon of an Excitement and of a Going of thy Star, and 
appertaineth not unto its Essence and Stability. So then 
to thee she is but Matter, and to her thou art but Ener-
gy; and neither is competent to the Formula of the other. 
Therefore also as thy Will is itself Imperfection, as I have 
shewed thee aforetime, thou art not in the Way of Love 
except thou be drest in that Robe of thine which thou 
callest Woman. And thou canst not lure her to this Action 
proper to her by thy Truth; but thou shalt, as our Gram-
mar sayeth, assume the Mask of the Spirit, that thou 
mayst evoke it by Sympathy. But thou shalt appear in 
thy Glory only when she is in thy Power, and bewildered 
utterly by Ecstasy. This is a Mystery, o my Son, and of 
old Time it was declared in the Fable of Scylla and 
Charybdis, which are the Formula of the Rock and of the 
Whirlpool. Now then meditate thou strictly upon this most 
worthy and most adorable Arcanum, to thy Profit and 
Enlightenment. 
'134 
DE DUOBUS PRAEMIIS VIAE 
LET it be a Treasure in thine Heart, o my Son, this 
Mystery that I shall next unveil before thine Eyes, o 
Eagle that thou art undazzled by the Brilliance of Light, 
that soarest continually with virile Flight to thine August 
Inheritance. Behold, the Beatific Vision is of two Orders, 
and in the Formula of the Rosie Cross it is of the Heart 
and is called Beauty; but in the Formula of the Silver 
Star (id est, of the Eye within the Triangle) it is of the 
Mind, and is called Wonder. Otherwise spoken, the for-
mer is of Art, a sensuous and creative Perception; but 
the latter of Science, an intellectual and intelligible In-
sight. Or again, in our Holy Qabalah, the one is of Ti-
phareth, the other of Binah; and in pure Philosophy, this 
is a Contemplation of the Cosmos Causal and Dynamic, 
and that of its Effect in Static Presentation. Now this 
Rapture of Art is a Virtue or Triumph of Love in his 
most universal Comprehension, but the Ecstasy of Science 
is a continual Orgasm of Light; that is, of the Mind. 
Thou sayest: o my Father, how may I attain unto this 
Fullness and Perfection? Art thou there, o my Son? It 
is well, and blessed be the Bed wherein thou wast be-
gotten, and the Womb of thy sweet Mother, Hilarion my 
Concubine, holy and adulterous, the Scarlet Woman! 
Amen. 
135 
DE ECSTASIA SAMADHI, QUO MODO AB 
HISS DIFFERT 
CONFUSE not thou this Beatific Vision with the Tran- 
ces called Samadhi; yet is Samadhi the Pylon of the 
Temple thereof For Samadhi is the Orgasm of the Coi-
tion of the Unlike, and is commonly violent, even as 
the Lightning cometh of the Discharge between two 
Vehicles of extreme difference of Potential. But, as I 
shewed formerly concerning Love, how each such Dis-
charge bringeth either Component more nigh to Equilib-
rium, so is it in this other Matter, and by Experience 
thou cornest constantly to Integration of Love (or what 
not) within thyself, just as all Effort becometh harmo-
nious and easy by Virtue of Practice. Rememberest thou 
the first time that thou wast thrown into Water, thy 
Fear and thy Struggles, and the Vehemence of thy Joy 
when first thou didst swim without Support? Then little 
by little all Violence dieth away, because thou art adjust-
ed to that Condition. Therefore the Fury of thine early 
Victory in these Arts Magical and Sciences is but the 
sign of thine own Baseness and Unworthiness, since the 
Contrast or Differential is so overwhelming to thee; but, 
becoming expert and Adept, thou art balanced in the 
Glory, and calm, even as tlje Stars. 
136 
DE ARTE AMORIS ET DELICIARTJM 
MYSTIC' 
THE Path therefore unto this Beatific Vision of Beauty, 
o my Son, is that Practice of Bhakti Yoga which is 
written in the Book called Eight Score and Fifteen, or 
Astarte, by this mine Hand when I was in Gaul the Be-
loved, at Montigny that is hard by the Forest of the Blue 
Fountain, with Agatha my Concubine, the very Soul of 
Love and of Musick, that had adventured herself from 
beneath the Cross Austral that she might seek me, to 
inspire and comfort me; and this was my Reward from 
the Masters, and Consolation in the Years of my Sorrow. 
But the Way that leadeth to the other Form of this Vision 
of Beatitude, to wit, Science, is Ghana Yoga or Raja 
Yoga, of which I have written only here and there, as one 
who should strew great Stones upon the Earth in Disorder, 
by Default of building them nobly into a Pyramid. And 
of this do I most heartily repent me, and ask of the God 
Thoth that He may give me (albeit at the Eleventh Hour) 
Virtue and Wit, that I may compose a True Book upon 
these Ways of Union. Thy first Step, therefore, o my 
Son, is to attain unto Samadhi, and to urge thyself per-
petually to Repetition of thy Success therein. For it hath 
been said by Philosophers of old that Practice maketh 
Perfect, and that Manners, being the constant Habit of 
Life, maketh Man. 
137 
DE PRAEMIO SUMMO, VERA SAPIENTIA 
ET BEATITUDINE PERFECTA 
NOW then presently shall it come to pass that, as by 
Dint of each Experience that Component thereof 
which is within thee is attuned to it, a slight Effort shall 
suffice to unite thee therewith, and this without Shock, 
so that thou art no longer thrown back from the Trance, 
as exhausted, but abidest therein, almost without Knowl-
edge of thy State. So then at last this Samadhi shall 
become normal to thy common Consciousness, as it were 
a Point of View. Thus all Things shall appear to thee 
very continually as to one in his first Love, by the Vision 
of Beauty; and by the Vision of Science thou shalt marvel 
constantly with Joy unfathomable at the Mystery of the 
Laws whereby the Universe is upheld. This is that which 
is written: flue Wisdom and Perfect Happiness. 0 my 
Son, it is in this Contemplation that one hath the Reward 
of the Path, it is by this that the Tribulations are rolled 
away as a Stone from thy Tomb, it is with this that thou 
art wholly freed from the Illusions of Distinction, being 
absorbed into the Body of Our Lady Nuit. May She 
grant to thee this Beatitude; yea, not to thee only, but 
to all that are. 
138 
DE INFERNO SERVORUM 
NOW o my Son, having understood the Heaven that is 
within thee, according to thy Will, learn this con-
cerning the Hell of the Slaves of the Slave-Gods, that it 
is a true Place of Torment. For they, restricting them-
selves, and being divided in Will, are indeed the Servants 
of Sin, and they suffer, because, not being united in Love 
with the whole Universe, they perceive not Beauty, but 
Ugliness and Deformity; and, not being united in Under-
standing thereof, conceive only of Darkness and Con-
fusion, beholding Evil therein. Thus at last they come, 
as did the Manichaeans, to find, to their Terror, a Division 
even in the One, not that Division which we know for 
the Craft of Love, but a Division of Hate. And this, 
multiplying itself, Conflict upon Conflict, endeth in 
Hotchpot, and in the Impotence and Envy of Choronzon, 
and in the Abominations of the Abyss. And of such the 
Lords are the Black Brothers, who seek by their Sorceries 
to confirm themselves in Division. Yet in this even is 
no trim Evil, for Love conquereth All, and their Corrup-
tion and Disintegration is also the Victory of BABALON. 
139 
RHAPSODIA DE DOMINA NOSTRA 
BLESSED be She, ay, blessed unto the Ages be Our 
Lady BABALON, that plieth Her Scourge upon me, 
even upon me, TO MEPA OlIPION, to compel me to 
Creation and to Destruction, which are One, in Birth and 
in Death, being Love! Blessed be She, uniting the Egg 
with the Serpent and restoring Man unto his Mother 
the Earth! Blessed be She, that offereth Beauty and 
Ecstasy in the Orgasm of every Change, and that exciteth 
thy Wonder and thy Worship by the Contemplation of 
Her Mind many-wiled! Blessed be She, that hath filled 
Her cup with every Drop of my Blood, so that my Life 
is lost wholly in the Wine of Her Rapture! Behold, how 
She is drunken thereon, and staggereth about the 
Heavens, wallowing in Joy, crying aloud the Song of 
uttermost Love! Is not She thy true Mother among the 
Stars, o my Son, and hast not thou embraced Her in the 
Madness of Incest and of Adultery? Yea, blessed be She, 
blessed be Her Name, and the Name of Her Name, unto 
the Ages! 
140 
RHAPSODIA DE ASTRO SUO 
omy Son, knowest thou not the Joy to lie in the Wilder- 
ness and to behold the Stars, in their Majesty of Mo-
tion calm and irresistible? Hast thou thought there that 
thou also art a Star, free because consciously in Accord 
with the Law and Determination of thy Being? It was 
thine own True Will that bound thee in thine Orbit; 
therefore thou speedest on thy Path from Glory unto 
Glory in continual Joy. 0 Son, o Reward of my Work, 
o Harmony and Completion of my Nature, o Token of 
my Toil, o Witness of my Love for thy sweet Mother, 
the holy and adulterous Hilarion my Concubine, adorable 
in thine Innocence as she in her Perfection, is not this 
verily Intoxication of the Spirit in the Innermost, to be 
free absolutely and eternally, to run and to return upon 
the Course in the Play of Love, to fulfil Nature constantly 
in Light and Life? "Afloat in the Aether, 0 my God, my 
God!" Without Support, without Constraint, wing thine 
own Way, o Swan, o Bliss of Brightness! 
141 
DE HARMONIA VOLUNTATIS ET 
PARCARUM 
THIS is the evident and final Solvent of the Knot Philo- 
sophical concerning Fate and Freewill, that it is thine 
own Self, omniscient and omnipotent, sublime in Eter-
nity, that first didst order the Course of thine own Orbit, 
so that that which befalleth thee by Fate is indeed the 
necessary Effect of thine own Will. These two, then, 
that like Gladiators have made War in Philosophy 
through these many Centuries, are made One by the Love 
under Will which is the Law of Thelema. 0 my Son, 
there is no Doubt that resolveth not in Certainty and 
Rapture at the Touch of the Wand of our Law, an thou 
apply it with Wit. Do thou grow constantly in the Assi-
milation of the Law, and thou shalt be made perfect. 
Behold, there is a Pageant of Triumph as each Star, free 
from Confusion, sweepeth free in his right Orbit; all 
Heaven acclaimeth thee as thou goest, transcendental in 
Joy and in Splendour; and thy Light is as a Beacon to 
them that wander afar, strayed in the Night. Amoun. 
142 
PARENTHESIS DE QUADAM VIRGINE 
NOW o my Son, I will declare unto thee the Virtue 
of that Part of Love which receiveth and draweth, 
being the Counterpart of thine own. For behold! I am 
moved in myself by the Absence of the Virgin that is 
appointed for me. And Her Eagerness of Purity doth 
encompass me with its soft Tenderness, and twineth about 
me with sweet Scent, so that my Mind is enkindled 
with a gentle Flame, luminous and subtle, and I write 
unto thee as in Dream. For in this Enchantment of Her 
Devotion I am caught up cunningly into Beatitude, with 
great Joy of the Gods that have bestrewn my Way with 
Flowers, ay, many Flowers and Herbs of Magick and of 
Holiness withal to match their Beauty. Nay, o my Son, 
I will cease from this mine Epistle unto thee for awhile, 
that I may rest in the Pleasure of this Contemplation, 
for it is a Solace ineffable, and Recreation like unto 
Sleep among the Mountains. Yea, can I wish thee more 
than this, that, coming to mine Age, thou mayst find a 
Virgin like unto this to draw thee with her Simplicity, 
and her embroidered Silence? 
143 
DE CONSTANTIA AMORIS, CORVO CANDID° 
THINK it not strange, my Son, that I, praising Adultery, 
should praise also Constancy and Delight therein. For 
this is to state ill thy Question. Herein is Truth, and 
Wisdom concerning this Matter, that so long as Love 
be not wholly satisfied, and equilibrated by entire Ful-
filment and Exchange, Constancy is a Point of thy Con-
centration, and Adultery a Division in thy Will. But when 
thou hast attained the Summit and Perfection in any 
Work, of what Worth is it to continue therein? Hast thou 
two Stomachs, as hath a Cow, to chew the Cud of a di-
gested Love? Yet, o my Son, this Constancy is not of 
Necessity a Stagnation. Nay, behold the body of Our 
Lady Nuit, therein are found certain twin Suns, that 
revolve constantly about each other. So also it may be 
in Love, that two Souls, meeting, discover each in the 
other such Wealth and Richness of Light and Love, that 
M One Phase of Life (or Incarnation) or even in many, 
they exhaust not that Treasure. Nor will I say that such 
are not in their Degree and Quality thrice fortunate. 
But to persist in Dullness, in Satiety, and in mutual Irri-
tation and Abhorrence, is contrary to the Way of Nature. 
So therefore there is no Rule in any such Case, but the 
Law shall give Light to every one that hath it in his Heart, 
and by that Wisdom let him govern himself. 
144 
DE MYSTERIO MALI 
MOREOVER, say not thou in thy Syllogism that, since 
na  every Change soever, be it the Creation of a Sym-
phony or a Poem or the Putrefaction of a Carcass, is an 
Act of Love, and since we are to make no Difference be-
tween any Thing and any other Thing, therefore all 
Changes are equal in Respect of our Praise. For though 
this be a Right Conclusion in the Term of thy Compre-
hension as a Master of the Temple, yet it is false in the 
Eyes of him that hath not attained to Understanding. 
So therefore any Change (or Phenomenon) appeareth 
noble or base to the imperfect Mind, according to its 
Consonance and Harmony with the Will that governeth 
that Mind. Thus, if it be thy Will to delight in Rhythm 
and (Economy of Words, the Advertisement of a Com-
modity may offend thee; but if thou art in need of that 
Merchandise, thou wilt rejoice therein. Praise then or 
blame aught, as seemeth good unto thee; but with this 
Reflexion, that thy Judgment is relative to thine own 
Condition, and not absolute. This also is a Point of Toler-
ance, whereby thou shalt avoid indeed those Things that 
are hateful or noxious to thee, unless thou canst (in Our 
Mode) win them by Love, by withdrawing thine Atten-
tion from them; but thou shalt not destroy them, for 
that they are without Doubt the Desire of another. 
145 
DE VIRTUTE TOLERANTIA 
UNDERSTAND then heartily, o my Son, that in the 
Light of this my Wisdom all Things are One, being 
of the Body of Our Lady Nuit, proper, necessary, and 
perfect. There is then none superfluous or harmful, and 
there is none honourable or dishonourable more than an-
other. Lot in thine own Body, the vile Intestine is of 
more Worth to thee than the noble Hand or the proud 
Eye, for thou canst lose these and live, but not that. 
Esteem therefore a Thing in Relation to thine own Will, 
preferring the Ear if thou love Musick, and the Palate 
if thou love Wine, but the essential Organs of Life above 
these. Have Respect also to the Will of thy Fellow, not 
hindering him in his Way save as he may overly jostle 
thee in thine. For by the Practice of this Tolerance thou 
shalt come sooner to the Understanding of this Equality of 
all Things in Our Lady Nuit, and so to the high Attain-
ment of Universal Love. Yet in thy partial and par-
ticular Action, as thou art a Creature of Illusion, do 
thou maintain the right Relation of one Thing to another, 
fighting if thou be a Soldier, or building if thou be a 
Mason. For if thou hold not fast this Discipline and 
Proportion, which alloweth its true Will to every Part 
of thy Being, the Error of one shall draw all after it into 
Ruin and Dispersion. 
146 
DE FORMULA DEORUM MORIENTILTM 
ALAS, my Son! this hath been fatal constantly to many 
a Man of noble Aspiration, that these Words were 
hidden from his Understanding. For there is a Balance 
in all Things, and the Body hath Charter to fulfil his 
Nature, even as the Mind hath. So to repress one Func-
tion is to destroy that Proportion which is wholesome, 
and wherein indeed all Health and Sanity have Consist-
ency. Verily, it is the Art of Life to develop each Organ 
of Body and Mind, or as I may say, Each Weapon of the 
Will to its Perfection, neither distorting any Use, nor 
suffering the Will of one Part to tyrannize over that of 
another. And this Doctrine (be it accursed!) that Pain 
and Repression are wholesome and profitable in them-
selves is a Lie born of Sin and of Ignorance, the false 
Vision of the Universe and of its Laws that is the Basis 
of the Averse Formula of the Slain God. It is true that 
on Occasion one Limb must be sacrificed to save the whole 
Body, as when one cutteth away an Hand that is bitten 
by a Viper, or as when a Man giveth his Life to save 
his City. But this is a right and natural Subordination 
of the superficial and particular to the fundamental and 
general Will, and moreover it is a Case extraordinary, 
relating to Accident or Extremity, not in any Wise a Rule 
of Life, or a Virtue in its Absolute Nature. 
147 
DE STULTIS MALIGNIS 
MY Son, there are Afflictions many and Woes many, 
that come of the Errors of Men in Respect of the 
Will; but there is none greater than this, the Interference 
of the Busy-Body. For they make Pretence to know a 
Man's Thought better than he doth himself, and to direct 
his Will with more Wisdom than he and to make Plans 
for his Happiness. And of all these the worst is he that 
sacrificeth himself for the Weal of his Fellows. He that 
is so foolish as not to follow his own Will, how shall he 
be so wise as to pursue that of another? If mine Horse 
balk at a Fence, should some Varlet come behind him, 
and strike at his Hoofs? Nay, Son, pursue thy Path in 
Peace, that thy Brother beholding thee may take Cour-
age from thy Bearing, and Comfort from his Confidence 
that thou wilt not hinder him by thy Superfluity of Com-
passion. Let me not begin to tell thee of the Mischiefs 
that I have seen, whose Root was in Kindness, whose 
Flower was in Self-Sacrifice, and whose Fruit in Catas-
trophe. Verily, I think there should be no End thereof. 
Strike, rob, slay thy Neighbour, but comfort him not un-
less he ask it of thee; and if he ask it, be wary. 
148 
APOLOGIA PRO SUM LITERIS 
HOW then, sayst thou, concerning this my Counsel unto 
thee? I say Sooth, it is of my Will to bring up this 
my Wisdom from its Silence into my conscious Mind, 
that I may the more easily reflect thereon. Thou art but 
a Pretext for my Action, and a Focus for my Light. 
Nevertheless, heed these my Words, for they shall profit 
thee, thou being of Age responsible in Judgment, and free 
in the Law of Thelema. Thus thou mayst read or no, con-
cur or no, as thou wilt. Have I not tutored thee in the Way 
of the Balance, or of Antithesis, shewing thee the Art of 
Contradiction, whereby thou dost accept no Word save as 
the Victor in thy Mind over its Opposite, nay more, as the 
Child Transcendental of a Marriage of Opposites? This 
Book then shall serve thee but as a Food for thy Medita-
tion, as a Wine to excite thy Mind to Love and War. It 
shall be unto thee as a Chariot to carry thee whither thou 
wilt; for I have seen in thee Independence and Sobriety 
of Judgment, with that Faculty (most rare, most noble!) 
to examine freely, neither obsequious nor rebellious to 
Authority. 
149 
LAUS LEGIS THELEMA 
THIS Property of thy Mind, my Son, is verily of su- 
blime Virtue; for the Vulgar are befogged, and their 
Judgment made null, by their emotional Reaction. They 
are swayed by the Eloquence of a Numscull or overpow-
ered by a Name, or an Office, or the Magic of a Tailor; 
else, it may be they, being made Fools too often, reject 
without Reflexion even as at first they accepted. Again, 
they are wont to believe the best or the worst, as Hope or 
Fear predominateth in them at the moment. Thus, they 
lose Touch of the Blade of Reality, and it pierceth them. 
Then they in Delirium of their Wounds increase Delusion, 
fortifying themselves in Belief of those Phantasies created 
by their Emotions or impressed upon their Silliness, so 
that their Minds have no Unity, or Stability, or Discrimi-
nation, but become Hotchpot, and the ordure of Choron-
zon. 0 my Son, against this the Law of Thelema is a Sure 
Fortress, for through the Quest of thy True Will the Mind 
is balanced about it, and confirmeth its Flight, as the 
Feathers upon a Arrow, so that thou hast a Touchstone 
of Truth, Experience holding thee to Reality, and to 
Proportion. Now therefore see from yet another Airt 
of Heaven the absolute Virtue of Our Law. 
150 
DE SPHINGE AEGYPTIORUM 
IT is now expedient that I instruct thee concerning the 
Four Powers of the Sphinx, the Strangler, and firstly, 
that this most arcane of the Mysteries of Antiquity was 
never at any Period the Tool of the slave-gods, but a 
Witness of Horus through the dark Aeon of Osiris to His 
Light and Truth, His Force and Fire. Thou canst by no 
means interpret the Sphinx in Terms of the Formula of 
the Slain God. This did I comprehend even when as 
Eliphaz Levi Zahed I walked up and down the Earth, 
seeking a Reconciliation of these Antagonists, which was 
a Task impossible, for in that Plane they have Antipathy, 
(Even so may no Man form a Square Magical of Four 
Units.) But the Light of the New Aeon revealeth this 
Sphinx as the True Symbol of this our Holy Art of Magick 
under the Law of Thelema. In Her is the Equal Develop-
ment and Disposition of the Forces of Nature, each in its 
Balanced Strength; also Her True Name is Soul of NU, 
having the Digamma for Phi, and endeth in Upsilon, not 
in Xi, so that her Orthography is 'TINT whose Numer-
ation is Six Hundred and Three Score and Six. But 
therein is my Riddle of Riddles. For the Root thereof 
is SF, which signifieth the Incarnation of the Spirit; 
and of Kin are not only The Sun, Our Father, but 
Sumer, where Man knew himself Man, and Soma, the 
divine Potion that giveth Men Enlightenment, and Scin, 
Light Astral, and Scire also, by a far Travelling. But 
especially is this Root hidden in Sus, that is of Sow, Swine, 
because the Most Holy must needs take its Delight under 
the Omphalos of the Unclean. But this was hidden by 
Wisdom, in order that the Arcanum should not be pro-
faned during the Aeon of the Slain God. But now it hath 
been given unto me to understand the Heart of Her 
Mystery, wherefore, o my Son, by Right of the great Love 
that I bear unto thee, I will inform thee thereof. 
151 
DE NATURA zFINt 
FIRSTLY, this Sphinx is a Symbol of the Coition of 
s  Our Lady BABALON with me THE BEAST in its 
Wholeness. For as I am of the Lion and the Dragon, so 
is She of the Man and the Bull, in our Natures, but the 
Converse thereof in our Offices, as thou mayst under-
stand by the Study of the Book of the Vision and The 
Voice. It is thus a Glyph of the Satisfaction and Perfec-
tion of the Will and of the Work, the Completion of the 
True Man as the Reconciler of the Highest with the Low-
est, so for our Convenience conventionally to distin-
guish them. This then is the Adept, who doth Will 
with solid Energy as the Bull, doth Dare with fierce 
Courage as the Lion, doth Know with swift Intelligence 
as the Man, and doth Keep Silence with soaring Sub-
tlety as the Eagle or Dragon. Moreover, this Sphinx is 
an Eidolon of the Law, for the Bull is Life, the Lion is 
Light, the Man is Liberty, the Serpent is Love. Now 
then this Sphinx, being perfect in true Balance, yet 
taketh the Aspect of the Feminine Principle, that so she 
may be Partner of the Pyramid, that is the Phallus, pure 
Image of Our Father the Sun, the Unity creative. The 
Signification of this Mystery is that the Adept must be 
whole, Himself, containing all Things in true Proportion, 
before He maketh Himself Bride of the One Universe 
Transcendental, in its most Secret Virtue. And now 
therefore, o my Son, comprehending this Mystery by 
thine Intelligence, I will write further unto thee of these 
Four Beasts or Powers. 
152 
DE TALMO 
CONCERNING the Bull, this is thy Will, constant and 
unwearied, whose letter is Vau, which is Six, the num-
ber of the Sun. He is therefore the Force and the Sub-
stance of thy Being; but, besides this, he is the Hierophant 
in the Taro, as if this were said that thy Will leadeth 
thee unto the Shrine of Light. And in the Rites of Mith-
ras the Bull is slain, and his Blood poured upon the 
Initiate, to endow him with that Will and that Power of 
Work. Also in the Land of Hind is the Bull sacred to 
Shiva, that is God among that Folk, and is unto them 
the Destroyer of all Things. And this God is also the 
Phallus, for this Will operateth through Love, even as 
it is written in our Own Law. Yet again, Apis the Bull 
of Khem hath Khephra the Beetle upon His Tongue, 
which signifieth that it is by this Will, and by this Work, 
that the Sun cometh unto Dawn from Midnight. All 
these Symbols are most similar in their Nature, save as 
the Slaves of the Slave-Gods have read their own For-
mula into the Simplicity of Truth.• For there is Naught 
so plain that Ignorance and Malice may not confuse and 
misinterpret it, even as the Bat is dazzled and bewildered 
by the Light of the Sun. See then that thou understand 
this Bull in Terms of the Law of this our Aeon of Life. 
153 
DE LEONE 
OF the Lion, o my Son, be it said that this is the Courage 
of thy Manhood, leaping upon all Things, and seizing 
them for thy Prey. His Letter is Teth, whose Implication 
is a Serpent, and the Number thereof Nine, whereof is 
Aub, the Secret Fire of Obeah. Also Nine is of Jesod, 
uniting Change with Stability. But in the Book of Thoth 
He is the Atu called Strength, or more truly, Lust, whose 
Number is ELEVEN which is Aud, the Light Odic of 
Magick. And therein is figured the Lion, even THE 
BEAST, and Our Lady BABALON astride of Him, that 
with her Thighs She may strangle Him. Here I would 
have thee to mark well how these our Symbols are cog-
nate, and flow forth the one into the other, because each 
Soul partaketh in proper Measure of the Mystery of Ho-
liness, and is Kin with his Fellow. But now let me shew 
how this Lion of Courage is more especially the Light in 
thee, as Leo is the House of the Sun that is the Father of 
Light. And it is thus: that thy Light, conscious of itself, 
is the Source and Instigator of thy Will, enforcing it to 
spring forth and conquer. Therefore also is his Nature 
strong with Hardihood and Lust of Battle, else shouldst 
thou fear that which is unlike thee, and avoid it, so that 
thy Separateness should ivcrease upon thee. For this 
Cause he that is defective in Courage becometh a Black 
Brother, and To Dare is the Crown of all thy Virtue, the 
Root of the Tree of True Magick. 
154 
ALTERA DE LEONE 
L°1 in the First of thine Initiations, when First the 
Hoodwink was uplifted from before thine Eyes, thou 
wast brought unto the Throne of Horus, the Lord of the 
Lion, and by Him enheartened against Fear. Moreover, 
in Minutum Mundum, the Map of the Universe, it is the 
Path of the Lion that bindeth the two highest Faculties 
of thy Mind. Again, it is Mau, the Sun at Brightness of 
High Noon, that is called the Lion, very lordly, in 
our Holy Invocation. Sekhet our Lady is figured as a 
Lioness, for that She is that Lust of Nuit toward Hadit 
which is the Fierceness of the Night of the Stars, and 
their Necessity; whence also is She true Symbol of thine 
own Hunger of Attainment, the Passion of thy Light to 
dare all for its Fulfilling. It is then the Possession of 
this Quality which determineth thy Manhood; for without 
it thou art not impelled to Magick, and thy Will is but the 
Slave's Endurance and Patience under the Lash. For 
this Cause, the Bull being of Osiris, was it necessary for 
the Masters of the Aeons to incarnate me as (more espe-
cially) a Lion, and my Word is first of all a Word of En-
lightenment and of Emancipation of the Will, shewing to 
every Man a Spring within Himself to determine His 
Will, that he may do that Will, and no more another's. 
Arise therefore, o my Son, arm thyself, haste to the 
Battle! 
155 
DE VMO 
LEARN now that this Lion is a natural Quality in Man, 
and secret, so that he is not ware thereof, except he 
be Adept. Therefore is it necessary for thee also To 
Know, by the Head of thy Sphinx. This then is thy 
Liberty, that the Impulse of the Lion should becomp 
conscious by Means of the Man; for without this thou art 
but an Automaton. This Man moreover maketh thee to 
understand and to adjust thyself with thine Environment, 
else, being devoid of Judgment, thou goest blindly upon 
an Headlong Path. For every Star in his Orbit holdeth 
not his Way obstinately, but is sensitive to every other 
Star, and his true Nature is to do this. Oh, Son, how 
many are they whom I have seen persisting in a fatal 
Course, in Sway of the Belief that their dead Rigidity was 
Exercise of Will! To Know: this is what teacheth thee 
how best thou mayst accomplish thy Will. And the 
Letter of the Man is Tzaddi, whose Number is Ninety, 
which is Maim, the Water that conformeth itself perfectly 
with its Vessel, that seeketh constantly its Level, that 
penetrateth and dissolveth Earth, that resisteth Pressure 
maugre its Adaptability, that being heated is of Force 
to drive great Engines, and being frozen breaketh the 
Mountains in Pieces. 0 my Son, seek well To Know 
156 
DE DRACONE, QUAE EST AQTJILA, 
SERPENS, SCORPIO 
THREEFOLD is the Nature of Love: Eagle, Serpent, 
and Scorpion. And of these the Scorpion is he 
that, having no Lion of Light and of Courage within him, 
seemeth to himself encircled by Fire, and, driving his 
Sting into himself, he dieth. Such are the Black Brothers, 
that cry: I am I; they that deny Love, restricting it to 
their own Nature. But the Serpent is the Secret Nature 
of Man, that is Life and Death, and maketh his Way 
through the Generations in Silence. And the Eagle is 
that Might of Love which is the Key of Magick, uplifting 
the Body and its Appurtenance unto High Ecstasy upon 
his Wings. It is by Virtue thereof that the Sphinx 
beholdeth the Sun unwinking, and confronteth the Pyra-
mid without Shame. Our Dragon, therefore, combining 
the Natures of the Eagle and the Serpent, is our Love, the 
Organon of our Will, by whose Virtue we perform the 
Work and Miracle of the One Substance, as saith thine 
Ancestor Hermes Trismegistus, in his Tablet of Smar-
agda. And this Dragon is called thy Silence, because in 
the Hour of his Operation that within thee which saith 
"I" is abolished in its Conjunction with the Beloved. For 
this Cause also is its Letter Nun, which in our Rota is 
the Trump Death; and Nun hath the Value of Fifty, the 
Number of the Gates of Understanding. 
157 
DE QUATTUOR VIRTUTIS FIN* 
SEE now our Sphinx, with what Subtility and Art it 
She made Whole! Here is thy Light, the Lion, the 
Necessity of thy Nature, fortified by thy Life, the Bull, 
the Power of Work, and guided by thy Liberty, the Man, 
the Wit to adapt Action to Environment. These are three 
Virtues in One, necessary to all proper Motion, as I may 
say in a Figure, the Lust of the Archer, the propulsive 
Force of his Arrri, and the equilibrating and directing 
Control of his Eye. Of these three if one fail, the Mark 
is not hit. But hold ! is not a fourth Element essential 
in the Work? Yea, soothly, all were vain without the 
Engine, Arrow and Bow. This Engine is thy Body, pos-
sessed by thee and used by thee for thy Work, yet not 
Part of thee, even so as are his Weapons to this Archer 
in my Similitude. Thus is thy Dragon to be cherished 
of thy Lion, but if thou lack Energy and Endurance of 
thy Bull, thy Tools lie idle, and if Cunning and Intel-
ligence, with Experience also, of thy Man, thy Shaft flieth 
crooked. So then, o my Son, do thou perfect thyself in 
these Four Powers, and that with Equity. 
158 
DE LIBRA, IN QUA QUATTUOR VIRTUTES 
AEQUIPOLLENT 
BY Giiana Yoga cometh thy Man to Knowledge; by 
Karma Yoga thy Bull to Will; by Raja Yoga is thy 
Lion brought to his Light; and to make perfect thy 
Dragon, thou hast Bhakta Yoga for the Eagle therein, and 
Hatha Yoga for the Serpent. Yet mark thou well how 
all these interfuse, so that thou m,ayst accomplish no one 
of the Works separately. As to make Gold thou must 
have Gold (it is the Word of the Alchemists) so to become 
The Sphinx thou must first be a Sphinx. For Naught 
may grow save to the Norm of its own Nature, and in the 
Law of its own Law, or it is but Artifice, and endureth 
not. So therefore is it Folly, and a Rape wrought upon 
Truth, to aim at aught but the Fulfilment of thine own 
true Nature. Order then thy Workings in Accord with 
thy Knowledge of that Norm as best thou rnayst, not heed-
ing the Importunity of them that prate of the Ideal. For 
this Rule, this Uniformity, is proper only to a Prison, and 
a Man liveth by Elasticity, nor endureth Rigor save in 
Death. But whoso groweth bodily by a Law foreign to 
his own Nature, he hath a Cancer, and his whole (Econ-
omy shall be destroyed by that small Disobedience. 
159 
DE PYRAMIDE 
NOW then at last art thou made ready to confront the 
Pyramid, when thou art established as a Sphinx. For 
it hath also the four square Base of Law, and the Four 
Triangles of Light, Life, Love, and Liberty for its Sides, 
that meet in a Point of Perfection that is Hadit, poised 
to the Kiss of Nuit. But in this Pyramid is no Differ-
ence of Form between the Sides, as it is in thy Sphinx, 
for these are wholly One, save in Direction. Thou art 
then an Harmony of the Four by Right of thine Attain-
ment of Adeptship, the Crown of thy Manhood, but not 
an Identity, as in Godhead. Therefore may it be said 
from one Point of Sight that thine Achievement is but a 
Preparation, an Adornment of the Bride for the Temple 
of Hymen, and his Rite. Verily, o my Son, I deem in 
my Wisdom that this whole Work of Thy Development 
to Sphinx-hood cometh before the Work of Theurgy, for 
the Lord descendeth not upon a Temple ill-conceived;and 
builded awry, nor abideth in a Shrine unworthy. Ac-
complish then this Task in Patience, with Assiduity, not 
hasting furiously after Godliness. For this is most sure, 
that to the Beauty of a Maiden answereth the Lust of her 
Lord, spontaneous, and without Effort or Appeal of her 
Contriving. 
160 
PROLEGOMENA DE SILENTIO 
BUT now concerning Silence, o my Son, I will have a 
further Word with thee. For thereby we mean not 
the Muteness of him that hath a Dumb Devil. This Si-
lence is the Dragon of thine Unconscious Nature, not only 
the Ecstasy or Death of thine Ego in the Operation of its 
Organ, but also, in its Unity with thy Lion, the Truth of 
thy Self. Thus is thy Silence the Way of the Tao, and 
all Speech a Deviation therefrom. This Lion and Dragon 
are therefore of thy Self, and the Man and the Bull the 
Feminine Counterparts thereof, being the Grace of Our 
Lady BABALON that She bestoweth upon thee in thine 
Adultery with Her. They are then as a Vesture of Hon-
our, and a Reward, that are won by the Intensity of thy 
Light and of thy Love. So properly we esteem Men by 
the Measure of their Intelligence and of their Strength, 
since they are equal in their essential Godhead, so far as 
concerneth the Quiddity thereof. See thou closely more-
over unto it, that if thou be well favoured of our Lady, 
thy Lion and thy Dragon grow in like Measure, for the 
Excess of the Feminine is Dead Weight. The Intellectual 
without Virility is a Dreamer of Follies, and the laborious 
Giant without Courage is a Slave. 
161 
DE NATURA SILENTII NOSTRI 
THE Nature of this Silence is shewn also by the God 
Harpocrates, the Babe in the Lotus, who is also the 
Serpent and the Egg, that is, the Holy Ghost. This is the 
most Secret of all Energies, the Seed of all Being, and 
therefore must He be sealed up in an Ark from the Malice 
of the Devourers. If then by thine Art thou canst con-
ceal thy Self in thine own Nature, this is Silence, this, 
and not Nullity of Consciousness, else were a Stone more 
perfect in Adeptship than thou. But, abiding in thy 
Silence, thou art in a City of Refuge, and the Waters 
prevail not against the Lotus that enfoldeth thee. This 
Ark or Lotus is then the Womb of Our Lady BABALON, 
without which thou wert the Prey of Nile and of the 
Crocodiles that are therein. Now, o my Son, mark thou 
well this that I will write for thine Advertisement and 
Behoof, that this Silence, though it be Perfection of 
Delight, is but the Gestation of thy Lion, and in thy Sea-
son thou must Dare, and come forth to the Battle. Else, 
were not this Practice of Silence akin to the Formula of 
Separateness of the Black Brothers? 
162 
DE FORMULA RECTA DRACONIS 
VERILY, o my Son, herein lieth the Danger and the 
Treason of thy Scorpion. For his Nature is against 
himself, being the deepest Ego, that is, a Being separate 
from the Universe; and this is the Root of the Whole Mys-
tery of Evil. For he hath in him the Magick Power, which 
if he use not, he is self-poisoned, even as any Organ of 
the Body that refuseth its Function. So then his Cure 
is in his Ally the Lion, that feareth not the Crocodiles, 
nor hideth himself, but leapeth eagerly forward. The 
Path of the Mystick hath this Pitfall; that, though he 
unite himself with his God, his Mode is to withdraw 
from that which himseemeth is not God, whereby he 
affirmeth and confirmeth the Demon, that is, Duality. 
Be thou instant therefore, o my Son, to turn from every 
Act of Love at the Moment of full Satisfaction, flinging 
the Invoked Might thereof against a new Opposite; for 
the Formula of every Dragon is Perpetual Motion or 
Change, and therefore to dwell in the Satisfaction of thy 
Nature is a Stagnation, and a Violation thereof, making 
the Duality of Conflict, which is the Falling Away to 
Choronzon. Unto the which be Restriction in the Name 
of BABALON. 
163 
DE SUA CARTA COELORUM 
Ipray thee to mark, o my Son, how the Grace of Nature 
was benignant at my Nativity, to the Right Balance 
and Formulation of my Sphinx. For Neptune was in the 
Sign of the Bull, giving Strength and Stability to my 
spiritual Essence. Uranus was ascending in the Lion, to 
fortify my Magical Will with Courage, and to turn it 
to the Salvation of Man. In the Waterman was Saturnus, 
to make mine Intelligence sober, profound, and capable 
of Labour. Jupiter, with Mercury His Herald, was in Scor-
pio, harmonizing me and my Word according to the Es-
sence of my Nature. Then of the others, Mars was exalted 
in the Goat, for physical Endurance of Toil; Sol was 
conjoined with Venus in the Balance, for Judgment in Art 
and in Life, and for Equability of Temper. Lastly, the 
Moon was in the Sign of the Fishes, her loved Abode, for 
a Gift of Sensitiveness and of Glamour. What then am I? 
I am a transient Effect of infinite Causes, a Child of 
Changes. There is no I, o thou that art not thou, else 
were I segregated, a Stagnation, a Thing of Hate and of 
Fear. But ever-moving, ever-changing, there is a Star in 
the Body of our Lady Nuit, whose Word is None and 
Two. 
164 
DE OPERE SUO 
Iam not I. Then, sayst thou, why is this Word? Know, 
o my Son, that this First Person is but a Common Fig-
ure of the Speech of Men, whereof the Magus may avail 
himself without Implication of Metaphysick. Yet in the 
Mystery of Illusion, which is the Instrument of the Uni-
versal Will, I will not say the Harlot of Its Pleasure, are 
manifested these many Stars, and amongst them that 
Logos of the Aeon of Horus whom thou callest TO MECA 
OHPION and thy Father. And this is by-come through 
Virtue of the Intensity of the Will to Change, through 
many a Serpent-Phase of Life and Death, until in the 
Play of the Game its Manifestation is the Utterance of 
this Word of the Aeon, this Law of Thelema, that shall 
be for a Season the Formula of the Magick of the Earth. 
Who then should inquire of the further Destiny of that 
Star, or of another? It is the Play of the Game, and the 
Operation of its Function shall suffice it. Rid thyself 
therefore of this Thought of "I" apart from All, but, 
attaining to Consciousness of All by Our True Way, 
contemplate the Play of Illusion by thine Instrument of 
Mind and Sense, leaving it without Care to continue in its 
own Path of Change. 
165 
DE FRATRIBUS NIGRIS 
o my Son, know this concerning the Black Brothers, 
them that exult: I am I. This is Falsity and Delusion, 
for the Law endureth not Exception. So then these Breth-
ren are not Apart, as they vainly think being wrought 
by Error; but are peculiar Combinations of Nature in 
Her Variety. Rejoice then even in the Contemplation of 
these, for they are proper to Perfection, and Adornments 
of Beauty, like a Mole upon the Cheek of a Woman Shall 
I then say that were it of thine own Nature, even thine, 
to compose so sinister a Complex, thou shouldst not strive 
therewith, destroying it by Love, but continue in that 
Way? I deny not this hastily, nor affirm; nay, shall I 
even utter any Hint of that which I may foresee? For 
it is in mine own Nature to think that in this Matter the 
Sum of Wisdom is Silence. But this I say, and that boldly, 
that thou shalt not look upon this Horror with Fear, or 
with Hate, but accept this as thou dost all else, as a Phe-
nomenon of Change, that is, of Love. For in a swift 
Stream thou mayst behold a Twig held steady for awhile 
by the Play of the Water, and by this Analogue thou 
mayst understand the Nature of this Mystery of the Path 
of Perfection. 
166 
DE ARTE ALCHEMISTICA 
WILT thou acquaint thyself now further at my Reproof 
concerning this Arcanum of Alchymia, the Art Egyp-
tian, how to make Gold? Of a Surety this is already in 
thy Knowledge, if thou examine by Our Holy Qabalah, 
what be the Forces that are the Influx upon Tiphareth, 
which is the Harmony and Beauty, or Sol, in every King-
dom of the Universe, so then also among Metals. Now 
this Influx is Fivefold. First, from the Crown descendeth 
the High Priestess in the Path of the Moon, for Inspi-
ration, and Imagination, and Idea; see to it that this Virgin 
be Pure, for herein Error is Illusion. Next, from the 
Father floweth the Virtue of the Star in the Path of the 
Water-bearer, for Initiative, and Energy, and Determi-
nation, in the Innermost. Third, from the Mother are 
the Lovers in the Path of the Twins, for Intellectual 
Wholeness, and for Adjustment to Environment. These 
Three are from the Supernals, and complete the Theorick 
of thy Work. After this, in the Praxis and Executive 
thereof thou hast the Hermit as an Influence from the 
Sphere of Jupiter in the Path of the Virgin, for Secrecy, 
and for Concentration, and for Prudence. Lastly, from 
the Sphere of Mars, travelleth Justice in the Path of the 
Balance, for Good Judgment, and Tact, and Art. 0 my 
Son, in this Chapter is more Wisdom than in Ten Thou-
sand Folios of the Alchemists! Study therefore to acquire 
Skill in this Method, and Experience; for this Gold is not 
only of the Metals, but of every Sphere, and this Key 
is of Virtue to enter every Palace of Perfection. 
167 
DE FEMINA: QUAE EST PROPRIA JOCO 
omy Son, hear this Wisdom of Experience, how at thy 
first Sight, when I put thee into the Arms of Ahitha 
thy sweet Stepmother my Concubine, such was thy Beau-
ty that she became enamoured of thee, crying aloud: Ay 
me, an such be the Fruit of thy Magick, o my Master, 
then let me, me also, even me, give myself utterly to this 
Holy Art! Then did I, becoming heavy in Spirit, make 
Question of her, saying: To what End? and at this was 
she confounded and brought into Bewilderment; but after 
a great While, fumbling in her Ort of Mind, made An-
swer, like a Scarecrow in a Field, so was it for Rags 
and Tatters of Thought. Thus yet more Atrabilious and 
Sluggard was this Liver of thy Father, so that I fell into 
a Gloom nigh unto Weeping. Then she beholding me with 
Amazement cried upon me thus: Art thou not glad in 
Heart, o my Master? At this I gave a Sigh, even as one 
nigh unto Death. And She: if this be so, then is no Need 
any more for me to give myself to Magick. Thereat, per-
ceiving yet again the Jest Universal of Our Lord Pan, 
was I swallowed up (like unto Jonah of Old Fable) in 
the Belly of the Whale called Laughter, and it seemeth 
to me at this present Writing that I am like to abide 
therein for the Time that remaineth to me in this Body. 
168 
DE FORMULA FEMINAE 
NOW this is the right Power and Property of a Woman, 
to arrange and to adjust all Things that exist in their 
proper Spheie, but not to create or to transcend. There-
fore in all practical Matters is She of Might and of Wit 
to produce an Effect consonant with her Mood. And her 
Symbol is Water, that seeketh the Level, whether for 
Wrath, eating away the Mountains (yet even in this mak-
ing smooth the Plains) or for Love, in Fecundity of Earth. 
But it is Fire of Man that hath heaved up those Moun-
tains, in huge Turmoil. Man then maketh Mischief and 
Trouble by his Violence, be his Will convenient to his 
Environment, or antipathetic; but Woman disturbeth by 
Manipulation, adroit or sinister as her Mood may be of 
Order or of Disorder. For any Man to meddle in Her Affair 
is Folly, for he comprehendeth not Quiet; so also for her 
to emulate him in his Office is Fatuity. Therefore in Mag-
ick though a Woman excel all Men in every Quality 
that is profitable to her for Attainment, yet she is Naught 
in that Work, even as a Man without Hands in the Shop 
of a Carpenter; for she hath not the Organism that might 
flake Use of this Opportunity. Of all this is she aware 
by her Instinct, for her Nature is to Understand, even 
without Knowledge; and if thou doubt herein the Wisdom 
of thy Sire, do thou seek out a Woman (but with Pre-
caution) and affirm these my Words. So shall she wax 
woundily wrath, and look griesly upon thee, proclaim-
ing in shrill Voice her manifold Excellences, which she 
hath, and concern this Matter not one Whit. 
169 
VERBA MAGISTRI SD! DE FEMINA 
OF a Thousand Years it is nigh unto the Fiftieth Part, 
o my Son, since I obtained Favour in the Sight of a 
great Master of Truth, whom Men called Allan Bennett, 
so that he received me for his Discipulus in Magick. And 
he was instant with me in this Matter, and vehement, 
adjuring his Gods that this (which I have myself here 
above declared unto thee) was the Truth concerning the 
Nature of Woman. But I being but a Youth, and head-
strong, and being enraptured in Love of Women, and 
Admiration of them, and Worship, delighting in them 
eagerly, and learning constantly from them, nourished 
by the Milk of their Mystery, as it should be for all True 
Men, did resist angrily the Doctrine of that Most Holy 
Man of God. And because (as it was written) he was a 
Vowed Virgin from his Birth, and had no Commerce with 
any in the Way of Carnality, I disabled his Judgment 
herein, as if he, being a Fish, had disallowed the Flight 
of Birds. But I, o my Son, am not wholly ignorant of 
Women, save as all Men must be in the Limitation of 
their Nature, for the Number of my Concubines is not 
notably or shamefully exceeded by that of the Phases of 
the Moon since my Birth. Many also have been mw  Dis-
ciples in Magick that were Women, and (more also) I do 
owe, acknowledging the same with open Gladness, the 
Greater Part of mine own Initiation and Advancement 
to the Operation of Women. Notwithstanding all these 
Things, I bow humbly before Allan Bennett, and repent 
mine Insolence, for his Saying was Sooth. 
170 
DE VIA PROPRIA FEMINIS 
IT is indeed easy for a Woman to obtain the Experiences 
of Magick, in a certain Sort, as Visions, Trances, and 
the Like; yet they take not Hold upon her, to transform 
her, as with Men, but pass only as Images upon a Spec-
ulum. So then a Woman advanceth never in Magick, 
but remaineth the same, rightly or wrongly ordered 
according to the Force that moveth Her. Here therefore 
is the Limit of her Aspiration in Magick, to abide joyous 
and obedient beneath the Man that her instinct shall 
divine, so that, becoming by Habit a Temple well-order-
ed, comely and consecrated, she may in her next Incar-
nation attract by her Fitness a Man-Soul. For this Cause 
hath Man esteemed Constancy and Patience as Qualities 
pre-eminent in Good Women, because by these she 
gaineth her Going toward Our Godliness, Her Ordeal 
therefore is principally to resist Moods, which make Dis-
order, that is of Choronzon. Unto the which be Restric-
tion in the Name of BABALON. Also, let her be content 
in this Way, for verily she hath a noble and an excellent 
Portion in Our Holy Banquet, and escapeth many a Peril 
that is proper to us others. Only, be she in Awe and 
Wariness, for in her is no principle of Resistance to Cho-
ronzon, so that if she become disordered in her Moods, 
as by Lust, or by Drunkenness, or by Idleness, she hath 
no Standard whereunto she may rally her Forces. In 
this see thou her need of a well-guarded Life, and of a 
True Man for her God. 
171 
DE HAC RE ALTERA INTELLIGENDA 
MARK then, o my Son, how in the Antient Books of 
Magick it is Man that selleth his Soul unto the Devil, 
but Woman that maketh Pact with him. For she hath 
constantly the Wit and Power to arrange Things at his 
Bidding, and she payeth this price of his Alliance. But 
a Man hath one Jewel, and, bartering this, he becometh 
the Mockery of Satanas. Let then this tutor thee in thine 
own Art of Magick, that thou employ Women in all Prac-
tical Matters, to order them with Cunning, but Men in 
thy Need of Transfiguration or Transmutation. In a Trope, 
let the Woman direct the Chess-Play of Life, but the 
Man alter the Rules, if he so will. Lo! in ill Play is Mis-
chief and Disorder, but in a New Law is Earthquake, 
and Destruction of the Root of Things . Therefore is Fear 
of any Man that is in Commerce with his Genius, for 
none knoweth if his Law shall amend the Game or do 
it Hurt; and of this the Proof is in Experience, won after 
the Victory of his Will, when there is no Way of Return; 
even thus saith the Poet, Vestigia Nulla Retrorsum . Nor 
do thou fear to create: for even as I have written in the 
Book of Lies (falsely so-called), thou canst create nothing 
that is not God. But beware of false Creations wrought 
by Women in whom is no Function thereof, for they are 
Phantoms, poisonous Vapours, bred of the Moon in her 
Witchcraft of Blood. 
172 
DE CLAVIBUS MORTIS ET DIABOLI, ARCANIS 
TAROT FRATERNITATIS R.C. 
TT shall profit thee much, o my Son, or I err, that I 
instruct thee in the Mystery of the Paths of Nun and 
of Ayin, that in our Rota are figured in the Atu called 
Death, and in that called The Devil. Of these Nun joineth 
the Sun with Venus, and is referred to Scorpio in the 
Zodiac. This Path is perilous, for it seeketh the Level, 
and may abase thee, except thou take Heed unto the 
Going. Of its three Modes, the Scorpion destroyeth him-
self, as if it were a Type of Animal Pleasure. Next, the 
Serpent is proper to Works of Change, or Magick; yet 
is he poisonous also unless thou hast Wit to enchant him. 
Lastly, the Eagle is subtlest in this Sort, so that this 
Path is proper to a Transcendental Labour. Yet are all 
these in the Way of Death, so that thy Wand is dissolved 
and corroded in the Waters of the Cup, and must be re-
newed by Virtue of thy Nature in Her Course. For Fire 
is extinguished by Water; but upon Earth it burneth 
freely, and is inflamed by the Wind. Understand also that 
which is written concerning the Vesica, that it is the 
Mother, giving Ease, Sleep, and Death, which Consola-
tions are eschewed by the True Man or Hero. 
173 
SEQUITUR DE HIS VHS 
NOW the Path of Ayin is a Link between Mercury and 
the Sun, and in the Zodiac importeth the Goat. This 
Goat is called also Strength, and standeth in the Merid-
ian at the Sunrise of Spring, and it is of his Nature to 
leap upon the Mountains. So therefore is he a Symbol 
of true Magick, and his Name is Baphomet, wherefore 
did I design him as an Mu of Thoth, the Fifteenth, and 
put his Image in the Front of My Book The Ritual of 
High Magick, which was the Second Part of my Thesis 
for the Grade of Major Adept, when I was clothed about 
with the Body called Alphonse Louis Constant. Now 
the Goat flieth not as doth the Eagle; but consider this 
also, that it is the true Nature of Man to dwell upon the 
Earth, so that his Flights are oft but Phantasy; yea, the 
Eagle also is bound to his Eyrie, nor feedeth upon Air. 
Therefore this Goat, making each Leap with Fervour, 
yet at all Times secure in his own Element, is a true 
Hieroglyph of the Magician. Mark also, this Path sheweth 
One continuous in Exaltation upon a Throne, and so is 
it the Formula of the Man, as the other was of the 
Woman. 
174 
DE OCULO HOOR 
say furthermore that this Path is of the Circle, and of 
the Eye of Horus that sleepeth not, but is vigilant. The 
Circle is all-perfect, equal every Way; but the Vesica 
hath bitter Need, and seeketh thy Medicine, that is of 
Right compounded for High Purpose, to ease her Infir-
mity. Thus is thy Will frustrated, and thy Mind dis-
tracted, and thy Work lamed, if indeed it be not brought 
to Naught. Also, thy Puissance in thine Art is minished, 
by a full Moiety, as I do esteem it. But the Eye of Horus 
hath no Need, and is free in his Will, not seeking a Level, 
not requiring a Medicine, and is fit and worthy to be 
the Companion and the Ally of thee in thy Work, as a 
Friend to thee, not Mistress and not Slave, that seek 
ever with Slyness and Deceit to encompass their own 
Ends There is moreover a Reason in Physics for my 
Word; study thou this Matter in the Laws of the Changes 
of Nature. For Things Unlike do in their Marriage 
produce a Child which is relatively Stable, and resisteth 
Change; but Things Like increase mutually the Potential 
of their Particular Natures. Howbeit, each Path hath his 
own Use; and thou being instructed in all Ways, choose 
thine with Discretion. 
175 
DE SUA INMATIONE 
MY Son, my Delight, Honey of the Comb of my Life, 
I will say also this concerning the Odds of the For-
mule of Male and Female, that mine Initiation was or-
dered as followeth. First, unto the Middle of the Way, 
the Attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of 
the Holy Guardian Angel, were these Men appointed to 
mine Aid, Jerome Pollitt of Kendal, Cecil Jones of Bas-
ingstoke, Allan Bennett of the Border, and Oscar Ecken-
stein of the Mountain, with no Woman. But after that 
Attainment hath Word come to me only through Women, 
Ouarda the Seer, and Virakam, and in mine Initiation 
into the Degree of Magus these, the Cat IAAPIUN thy 
Mother, Helen the Play-Actress the Serpent, with Myr-
iamne the Drunkard and Rita the Harlot to bear Dagger 
and Poison; then these others Alice the Singing Woman 
for a Monkey, and Gerda the Madwoman for an Owl; 
then Catherine the Dog of Anubis, and Ahitha the Camel 
that renewed the Work of Virakam, with Olun the Drag-
on and — but here do I restrict myself in Speech, for 
the End is wrapped about with a Veil, as it were, the 
Face of a Virgin. But do thou meditate strictly upon these 
Things, distinguishing the right Property, Order, and Use 
of the one and the other in the Relative, even as thou 
makest them All-One, that is None, in the Absolute. 
176 
DE HERBO SANCTISSIMO ARABICO 
RECALL, o my Son, the Fable of the Hebrews, which 
they brought from the City Babylon, how Nebuchad-
nezzar the Great King, being afflicted in his Spirit, 
did depart from among Men for Seven Years' Space, 
eating Grass as doth an Ox. Now this Ox is the Letter 
Aleph, and is that Atu of Thoth whose Number is Zero, 
and whose Name is Maat, Truth, or Maut, the Vulture, 
the All-Mother, being an Image of Our Lady Nuit, but 
also it is called the Fool, who is Parsifal, 'der reine Thor,' 
and so referreth to him that walketh in the Way of the 
Tao. Also, he is Harpocrates, the Child Horus, walking 
(as saith Daood, the Badawi that became King, in his 
Psalms), upon the Lion and the Dragon; that is, he is in 
Unity with his own Secret Nature, as I have shewn thee 
in my Word concerning the Sphinx. 0 my Son, yester 
Eve came the Spirit upon me that I also should eat the 
Grass of the Arabians, and by Virtue of the Bewitch-
ment thereof behold that which might be appointed for 
the Enlightenment of mine Eyes. Now then of this may 
I not speak, seeing that it involveth the Mystery of the 
Transcending of Time, so that in One Hour of our Terres-
trial Measure did I gather the Harvest of an Aeon, and 
in Ten Lives I could not declare it. 
177 
DE QUIBUSDAM MYSTERIIS, QUAE VIM 
yET even as a Man may set up a Memorial or Symbol 
to import Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand, so 
may I strive to inform thine Understanding by Hiero-
glyph. And here shall thine own Experience serve us, 
because a Token of Remembrance sufficeth him that is 
familiar with a Matter, which to him that knoweth it 
not should not be made manifest, no, not in a Year of 
Instruction. Here first then is one amid the Uncounted 
Wonders of that Vision: upon a Field blacker and richer 
than Velvet was the Sun of all Being, alone. Then about 
Him were little Crosses, Greek, overrunning the Heaven. 
These changed from Form to Form geometrical, Marvel 
devouring Marvel, a Thousand Times a Thousand in their 
Course and Sequence, until by their Movement was the 
Universe churned into the Quintessence of Light. More-
over at another Time did I behold All Things as Bullae, 
iridescent and luminous, self-shining in every Colour 
and every Combination of Colour, Myriad pursuing Myr-
iad until by their perpetual Beauty they exhausted the 
Virtue of my Mind to receive them, and whelmed it, so 
that I was fain to withdraw myself from the Burden of 
that Brilliance. Yet, o my Son, the Sum of all this 
amounteth not to the Worth .  of one Dawn-Glimmer of 
Our True Vision of Holiness. 
178 
DE QUODAM MODO MEDITATIONIS 
NOW for the Chief of that which was granted unto 
me, it was the Apprehension of those willed Changes 
or Transmutations of the Mind which lead into TY' uth, 
being as Ladders unto Heaven, or so I called them at 
that Time, seeking for a Phrase to admonish the Scribe 
that attended on my words, to grave a Balustre upon 
the Stela of my Working. But I make Effort in vain, 
0 My Son, to record this Matter in Detail; for it is the 
Quality of this Grass to quicken the Operation of Thought 
it may be a Thousandfold, and moreover to figure each 
Step in Images complex and overpowering in Beauty, 
so that one hath not Time wherein to conceive, much 
less to utter, any Word for a Name of any one of them. 
Also, such was the Multiplicity of these Ladders, and 
their Equivalence, that the Memory holdeth no more 
any one of them, but only a certain Comprehension of 
the Method, wordless by Reason of its Subtility. Now 
therefore must I make by my Will a Concentration 
mighty and terrible of my Thought, that I may bring 
forth this Mystery in Expression. For this Method is of 
Virtue and Profit; by it mayst thou come easily and with 
Delight to the Perfection of Truth, it is no Odds from 
what Thought thou makest the first Leap in thy Medi-
tation, so that thou mayst know how every Road endeth 
in Monsalvat, and the Temple of the Sangraal. 
179 
SEQUITUR DE HAC RE 
Ibelieve generally, on Ground both of Theory and Expe- 
rience, so little as I have, that a Man must first be 
Initiate, and established in Our Law, before he may use 
this Method. For in it is an Implication of our Secret En-
lightenment, concerning the Universe, how its Nature 
is utterly Perfection. Now every Thought is a Separation, 
and the Medicine of that is to marry Each One with its 
Contradiction, as I have shewed formerly in many Writ-
ings. And thou shalt clap the one to the other with Ve-
hemence of Spirit, swiftly as Light itself, that the Ecstasy 
be Spontaneous. So therefore it is expedient that thou 
have travelled already in this Path of Antithesis, know-
ing perfectly the Answer to every Glyph or Problem, 
and thy Mind ready therewith. For by the Property of 
this Grass all passeth with Speed incalculable of Wit, 
and an Hesitation should confound thee, breaking down 
thy Ladder and throwing back thy Mind to receive Im-
pression from Environment, as at thy first Beginning. 
Verily, the Nature of this Method is Solution, and the 
Destruction of every Complexity by Explosion of Ecstasy, 
as every Element thereof is fulfilled by its Correlative, 
and is annihilated (since it loseth Separate Existence) 
in the Orgasm that is consummated within the Bed of 
thy Mind. 
180 
SEQUITUR DE HAC RE 
THOU knowest right well, o my Son, how a Thought 
is imperfect in two Dimensions, being separate from 
its Contradiction, but also constrained in its Scope, be-
cause by that Contradiction we do not (commonly) com-
plete the Universe, save only that of its Discourse. Thus 
if we contrast Health with Sickness, we include in their 
Sphere of Union no more than one Quality that may be 
predicated of all Things. Furthermore, it is for the most 
Part not easy to find or to formulate the true Contra-
diction of any Thought as a positive Idea, but only as a 
Formal Negation in vague Terms, so that the ready An-
swer is but Antithesis. Thus to "White" one putteth not 
the Phrase "All that which is not White," for this is void, 
formless; it is neither clear, simple, nor positive in 
Conception; but one answereth "Black," for this hath an 
Image of his Significance. So then the Cohesion of 
Antitheticals destroyeth them only in Part, and one 
becometh instantly conscious of the Residue that is un-
satisfied or unbalanced, whose Eidolon leapeth in thy 
Mind with Splendour and Joy unspeakable. Let not this 
deceive thee, for its Existence proveth its Imperfection, 
and thou must call forth its Mate, and destroy them by 
Love, as with the former. This Method is continuous, 
and proceedeth ever from the Gross to the Fine, and from 
the Particular to the General, dissolving all Things into 
the One Substance of Light. 
181 
CONCLUSIO DE HAC MODO SANCTITATIS 
LEARN now that Impressions of Sense have Opposites 
readily conceived, as long to short, or light to dark; 
and so with Emotions and Perceptions, as Love to Hate, 
or false to true; but the more Violent is the Antagonism, 
the more is it bound in Illusion, determined by Relation. 
Thus the Word 'Long' hath no Meaning save it be refer-
red to a Standard; but Love is not thus obscure, because 
Hate is its twin, partaking bountifully of a Common Na-
ture therewith. Now, hear this : it was given unto me 
in my Visions of the Aethyrs, when I was in the Wild-
erness of Sahara, by Tolga, upon the Brink of the Great 
Eastern Erg, that above the Abyss Contradiction is Unity, 
and that nothing could be true save by Virtue of the Con-
tradiction that is contained in itself. Behold therefore, 
in this Method thou shalt come presently to Ideas of this 
Order, that include in themselves their own Contradic-
tion, and have no Antithesis. Here then is thy Lever of 
Antinomy broken in thine Hand; yet, being in true Bal-
ance, thou mayst soar, passionate and eager, from Heaven 
to Heaven, by the Expansion of thine Idea, and its Exal-
tation, or Concentration as thou understandest by thy 
Studies in the Book of the Law, the Word thereof con-
cerning Our Lady Nuit, and Hadit, that is the Core of 
every Star. And this last Going upon thy Ladder is 
easy if thou be truly Initiate, for the Momentum of thy 
Force in Transcendental Antithesis serveth to propel 
thee, and the Emancipation from the Fetters of Thought 
that thou hast won in that Praxis of Art maketh the 
Whirlpool and Gravitation of Truth of Competence to 
draw thee unto itself.

DE VIA SOLA SOLIS 
THIS is the Profit of mine Intoxication of this holy 
Herb, The Grass of the Arab, that it hath shewed me 
this Mystery (with many others) not as a New Light, for 
I had that aforetime, but by its swift Synthesis and Ma-
nifestitation of a long Sequence of Events in a Moment, 
I had Wit to analyse this Method and to discover its Es-
sential Law, which before had escaped the Focus of the 
Lens of mine Understanding. Yea, o my Son, there is no 
True Path of Light, save that which I have formerly made 
plain ; yet in every Path is Profit, if thou be cunning to 
perceive it and to clasp it. For we win Truth oftentimes 
by Ref lexion, or by the Composition and Selection of an 
Artist in his Presentation thereof, when else we were 
blind thereunto lacking his Mode of Light. Yet were 
that Art of none avail unless we had already the Root of 
that Truth in our Nature, and a Bud ready to flower at 
the Summoning of that Sun, In Witness, nor a Boy nor 
a Stone hath Knowledge of the Sections of a Cone, and 
their Properties; but thou mayst teach these to the Boy 
by right Presentation, because he hath in his Nature those 
Laws of Mind that are consonant with our Art Mathe-
matical, and hath Need only of Fledging (I may say this) 
so that he apply them consciously to the Work, when all 
being in Truth, that is, in the necessary Relations that 
rule our Illusion, he cometh in Course to Apprehension. 
183 
DE PRUDENTIA FRATERNITATIS A A 
HERE then, o My Son, that shall be mightier than all the 
Kings of the Earth, as it is prophesied—an thou be 
He!—because thou shalt establish the Law which I have 
given, even the Law of Thelema, here in this which I 
have written is a Point of Judgment in thy Work to bring 
into the Light of Initiation such as come unto thee, affirm-
ing their Will to this Attainment. For every One hath 
his own Path and his own Law, and there is no Art in 
Magick but to seek out that Path, and that Law, that he 
may pursue the one by the Right Use of the other. It shall 
be that one cometh unto thee, desiring Amen-Ra (I speak 
in a Figure or Exemplar), another Asi, a third Hoor-Pa-
Kraat ; or again, one seeketh Instruction in Obeah, and 
his Fellow in Wanga ; and of all these not one in Ten 
Thousand shall be aware of his True Way. For albeit 
our Last Step is One for all, yet his Next Step is partic-
ular to each. Therefore is the Preparation of a Student 
that seeketh Our Holy Order of A .•. A most general, 
informing his Mind of all known Methods, so that his 
Will may select among these by Instinct; then after, as 
a Probationer he practiseth those which he hath prefer-
red, and by the Examination of his Record after the 
Period appointed thou mayst have Wisdom concerning 
him, to confirm him in those Ways which are thereby 
shewed to be germane to his True Nature. 
184 
ALTERA DE SUA VIA 
THUS I was brought into the Knowledge of myself in a 
certain Secret Grace, and as a Poet, by Jerome Pollitt 
of Kendal; Oscar Eckenstein of the Mountain discovered 
Manhood in me, teaching me to endure Hardship, and to 
dare many Shapes of Death; also he nurtured me in 
Concentration, the Art of the Mystics, but in Science 
without Lumber of Theology. Allan Bennett bestowed 
upon me the right Art of Magick, and our Holy Qabalah, 
with a great Treasure of Learning in many Matters, but 
especially concerning Egypt, and Asia, the Mysteries of 
their Arcane Wisdom. But of Cecil Jones had I the 
Great Gift of the Holy Magick of Abramelin, and he in-
ducted me into that Order which we name not, because 
of the Silliness of the Profane that pretend thereto, and 
he brought me to the Knowledge and Conversation of the 
Holy Guardian Angel; also, he was the Herald of the 
Masters of the Temple, when They bade me Welcome to 
their Order, appointing a Siege for me in the City of the 
Pyramids, under the Night of Pan ; but for Three Years I 
was not willing to avail myself thereof. Now mark well 
this, o my Son, that this Path was peculiar to the Law of 
my Star, and none other should follow me herein, or seek 
to follow me, for he hath his own proper Orbit. 0 my 
Son, err not by Generalization and Conformity, for this 
is of Very Idleness, and breedeth Ideals and Standards, 
that are Death. 
185 
DE PRUDENTIA ARTIS DOCENDI 
NEVERTHELESS, this one Affliction shall touch nigh 
all that come to thee, and that is this Great Pox of 
Sin, that is our Bane inherited of the Aeon of Slain Gods. 
Look then first of all, when any Postulant boweth before 
thee, whether there be not Conflict and Restriction in 
his Mind, and in his Will. If he deem Good and Evil to 
be absolute, instead of as relative to the Health of Ms 
Body, or the Weal of the Society of which he is a Member, 
or what not, as it may be, instruct him. Or, if he say 
that he will sacrifice all for Initiation, correct him, as it is 
written: "but whoso gives one particle of dust shall lose 
all in that hour." For it is Conflict if he weigh one Thing 
with another; and Renunciation, being sorrowful, is not 
worthy of Acceptance. But he must with Joy unite all 
that he is and hath, heaping the Whole into one Billow of 
Love, under Will. Yea, o my Son, until thou hast 
brought the Postulant into our Freedom from Sin, and 
the Sense and Conviction thereof, he is not ready for the 
Path of Our Magick and Illumination; because every 
Way cnever is a Going, and this Sin is an Obstacle and 
a Fetter and an Hoodwink on every one of them, for it is 
Restriction, whether he set out by the Meditations of the 
Dhamma, or by Our Qabalah, or by Vision, or Theurgy, 
or how else soever. 
186 
DE MENTE INIMICA ANIMO 
HOW shall a Man attain to the Trance where All is 
One, if he yet debate within his Mind concerning 
Virtue as a Thing Absolute? Thus, o my Son, there be 
those that are fuddled with Doubt whether Meat is to be 
Eaten (I choose this as a Reference), which Habit is proper 
to the Lion, as Grass to the Horse, so that his right Prob-
lem is solely this, what is fitting to his own Nature. Or 
again, I suppose that he is in Vision, and an Angel, visit-
ing him, imparteth a Truth contrary to his Prejudice, as 
it fell out in mine own Case, when I inhabited the Body 
of Sir Edward Kelly, or so I do in Part remember, as it 
seemeth albeit dimly. This nevertheless is sure (or the 
learned Casaubon, publishing the Record of that Word 
with the Magician Dee, sayeth falsely) that an Angel did 
declare unto Kelly the Very Axiomata of Our Law of 
Thelema, in good Measure, and plainly; but Dee, afflict-
ed by the Fixity of his Tenets that were of the slave-gods, 
was wroth, and by his Authority prevailed upon the 
other, who was indeed not wholly perfected as an In-
strument, or the World ready for that Sowing. Consider 
also how in this very Life I was the Enemy of my own 
Law, and wrote down the Book of the Law contrary to 
my conscious Will by the Virtue of Obedience as a Scribe, 
and strove constantly to escape mine own Work, and the 
Utterance of my Word, until by Initiation I was made 
All-One. 
187 
DE ILLUMINATORUM OPERIBUS DIVERSIS 
nO thou then understand how few be they whose Work 
in this their present Lives is our Way of Initiation. Yet 
it is written in the Book of the Law that the Law is for 
all, so that thou shalt in no wise err if thou establish it as 
the Formula of the Aeon, universal among Men. Also, 
even for them that are fitted to advance in our Light, 
there is Order and Diversity in Function, as regardeth 
their Work in Our Sublime Brotherhood. Thus, it might 
well be that, in a Profess-House of the Temple, or College 
of the Holy Ghost, each Knight or Brother might severally 
attain Experience of every Trance, unto the Perfection of 
all Illumination; yet by this there ought not Confusion 
to be confected, one usurping the appointed Office of 
another. For the Abbot, although he be not enlightened 
wholly, is yet Abbot; and the Place of the Cook, were he 
Saint, Arhan, and Paramahamsa in one Person, is in his 
Kitchen. Confound not thou in any wise therefore the 
Degree of Attainment of any Man with his right Function 
in Our Holy Order; for although by Initiation cometh 
the Light, and the Right, and the Might to accomplish 
all Works soever, yet these are inoperative save as they 
are able to use a Machine which is of the same Order of 
Things as the Effect required. As the best Swordsman 
hath Need of a Sword, so hath eVery Magician of a Body 
and Mind capable to the Work that he willeth; and he 
can do nothing, save it be proper to his Nature. 
188 
DE EADEM RE ALTERA VERBA 
BY this Understanding be they rebuked that make a Re- 
proach to our Art, saying in their Insolence that if we 
have all Power, why are we betimes in Stress of Pover-
ty, and in Contempt of Men, and in Pain of Disease, and 
so forth, mocking us, and holding our Magick for Delu-
sion. But they behold not our Light, how it guideth us 
in our Path unto a Goal that is not in their Comprehen-
sion, so that we crave not that which seemeth to them 
the sole Food and Comfort of Life. Also, this which we 
attain, though it be the Essence of Omniscience and Omni-
potence, informeth and moveth the Material World (so 
to call it) only according to the Nature of that which is 
therein. For the Light of the Sun (by His very Whole-
ness itself) sheweth a Rose red, but a Leaf green; and His 
Heat gathereth the Clouds, and disperseth them also. So 
I then, though I were perfect in Magick, might not work 
in Metals as a Smith, or become rich by Commerce as a 
Merchant; for I have not in my Nature the Engines prop-
er to these Capacities, and therefore it is not of my Will 
to seek to exercise them. Here then is my Case, that I 
can not because I will not; and it were Conflict, should 
I turn thither. But let every Man become perfect in his 
own Work, not heeding the Rebuke of another, that some 
Way not his own is more Noble, or Profitable, but being 
constant in Mindfulness concerning his Business. 
189 
DE PACE PERFECTA LUCE 
HOW shall they measure our Stature and our Success 
by their Canon of Relation and Illusion, and their 
Ignorance of our Nature? Time is but Sequence, and a 
moment of Light outweigheth an Age of Darkness. What 
is Happiness but an Issue of the Harmony of our Cons-
ciousness with our Truth, and the Conformity of Will 
with Action? To the Initiate is Certainty of his Fulfil-
ment, which to the Profane is but the Effect of Hazard, 
and he feareth to lose what he loveth, or thinketh he 
loveth. But we, loving only in Light, suffer not by Fear 
or by Bereavement, because to us every Event is Wel-
come, being right, necessary and proper to our particular 
Path. The Knowledge of this One Matter is the End of 
Dread and of Regret ; make thou it the Governor of thy 
Mind, to rule its Pace, lest it hasten or lag by Stress of 
thine Environment. Now this Attainment is possible for 
all Mankind, since it asketh but Resolution of Complex-
ities that already exist; so that this True Wisdom and 
Perfect Happiness cometh by the Acceptance of our Law, 
and its Use is the Key to all Locked Doors of the Soul, the 
Solvent of every Knot of the Mind, and the Reconcile-
ment of every Contention. 0 my Son, in the Promulga-
tion of the Law lieth the Reward of our Chief Work, the 
making whole of Mankind from that Conscience of Sin 
which divideth him, and afflicteth his Spirit. 
190 
DE PACE PERFECTA 
oMY Son, is it not a Marvel, this Light whereof we are 
the Quintessence and the Seed? By it are we made 
Whole, dissolved in the Body and in the Soul of Our 
Lady Nuit even as Her Lord Hadit, so that the Gnostic 
Sacrament of the Cosmos is perpetually Elevated before 
us. We behold all that is and comprehend its Mystery, 
and its Order in this High Mass eternally celebrated 
among us, acknowledging the Perfection of the Rite, 
neither confusing the Parts thereof, nor discriminating 
in Worship between them. So unto us is every Phenom-
enon a Shew of Godliness, proceeding continually in a 
Pageant that returneth unto itself, identical in the Phase 
of Naught as of Many, but whirling in the Orgia of Inef-
fable Holiness as it were a Dance that weaveth Figures of 
Beauty in Variety inexhaustible. Shall the Initiate be-
stir him, to better so prime a Perfection? Nay, this Will 
that was his is accomplished ; he hath attained the Sum-
mit; so without Hope or Fear he abideth, and leaveth 
his Vehicle of Illusion and Magical Engine, that is, as 
Men say, his Body and Mind, to work out their Ritual of 
Change without his Interference. 0 my Son, ask not to 
what End! As it is written in the Book of the Heart Girt 
with the Serpent, concerning the Boy and the Swan: Is 
there not Joy ineffable in this aimless Winging? 
191 
DE MORTE 
THOU hast made Question of me concerning Death, and 
this is mine Opinion, of which I say not: This is the 
Truth. First in the Temple called Man is the God, his 
Soul, or Star, individual and eternal, but also inherent in 
the Body of Our Lady Null. Now this Soul, as an Offi-
cer in the High Mass of the Cosmos, taketh on the Vesture 
of his Office, that is, inhabiteth a Tabernacle of Musion, a 
Body and Mind. And this Tabernacle is subject to the 
Law of Change, for it is complex, and diffuse, reacting to 
every Stimulus or Impression. If then the Mind be at-
tached constantly to the Body, Death hath not Power to 
decompose it wholly, but a decaying Shell of the Dead 
Man, his Mind holding together for a little his Body of 
Light, haunteth the Earth, seeking (in its Error, that 
feareth Change) a new Tabernacle in some other Body. 
These Shells are broken away utterly from the Star that 
did enlighten them, and they are Vampires, obsessing 
them that adventure themselves into the Astral World 
without Magical Protection, or invoke them, as do the 
Spiritists. For by Death is Man released only from the 
Gross Body, at the first, and is complete otherwise upon 
the Astral Plane, as he was in his Life. But this Whole-
ness suffereth Stress, and its Girders are loosened, the 
weaker first, and after that the stronger. 
192 
DE ADEPTIS RM. MSCHATOLOGIA 
CONSIDER now in this Light what shall come to the 
Adept, to him that hath aspired constantly and firmly 
to his Star, attuning the Mind unto the Musick of its Will. 
In him, if his Mind be knit perfectly together in itself, 
and conjoined with the Star, is so strong a Confection 
that it breaketh away easily not only from the Gross 
Body, but the Fine. It is this Fine Body which bindeth 
it to the Astral, as did the Gross to the Material, World; 
so then it accomplisheth willingly, the Sacrament of a 
Second Death, and leaveth the Body of Light. But the 
Mind, cleaving closely by Right of its Harmony, and 
Might of its Love, to its Star, resisteth the Ministers of 
Disruption, for a Season, according to its Strength. Now, 
if this Star be of those that are bound by the Great Oath, 
incarnating without Remission because of Delight in the 
Cosmic Sacrament, it seeketh a new Vehicle in the Ap-
pointed Way, and indwelleth the Foetus of a Child, and 
quickeneth it. And if at this Time the Mind of its Former 
Tabernacle yet cling to it, then is there Continuity of 
Character, and it may be Memory, between the two 
Vehicles. This, briefly and without Elaboration, is the 
Way of Asar in Amennti, according to mine Opinion, of 
which I say not: This is the Truth. 
193 
DE NUPTIIS SUMMIS 
NOW then to this Doctrine, o my Son, add thou that 
which thou hast learned in the Book of the Law, that 
Death is the Dissolution in the Kiss of Our Lady Nuit. 
This is a true Consonance as of Bass with Treble; for 
here is the Impulse that setteth us to Magick, the Pain of 
the Conscious Mind. Having then Wit to find the Cause 
of this Pain in the Sense of Separation, and its Cessation 
by the Union of Love, it is the Summit of Our Holy Art 
to present the whole Being of Our Star to Our Lady 
in the Nuptial of our Bodily Death. We are then to 
make our whole Engine the true and real Appurten-
ance of our Force, without Leak, or Friction, or any 
other Waste or Hindrance to its Action. Thou know-
est well how an Horse, or even a Machine propelled by a 
Man's Feet, becometh as it were an Extension of the 
Rider, through his Skill and Custom. Thus let thy Star 
have Profit of thy Vehicle, assimilating it, and sustaining 
it, so that it be healed of its Separation, and this even in 
Life, but most especially in Death. Also thou oughtest 
to increase thy Vehicle in Mass by true Growth in Bal-
ance that thou be a Bridegroom comely and well-fa-
voured, a Man of Might, and a Warrior worthy of the 
Bed of so divine a Dissolution. 
194 
DE ARTE VOLUPTATIS DILEMMA QUAEDAN1 
THERE is a named Objection, o my Son, to our Thesis 
concerning Will that it should flow freely in its Way; 
vide licet, that for such as I am it is well, because I am 
endowed by Nature with a Lust insatiable in every Kind, 
Sc. that the Universe itself seemeth incapable to appease 
it. For I have poured myself out unceasingly, in Bodily 
Passion, and in Battles with Men, and with Wild Beasts, 
and with Mountains and Deserts, and in Poetry and other 
Writings of the Musick of mine Imagination, and in Books 
of our Own Mysteries, and in Works Magical, and in Arts 
Plastic and so forth, so that in mine Age I am become 
verily a Slave to mine own Genius; and my Law is that 
unless I sleep or create, my Soul is sick, and fain to claim 
the Reward and the Recreation of my Death. But (I hear 
thee say it) this is not the Case of All, or even of many, 
Men; but their Ort of Will is satisfied easily at its first 
Guerdon. Should not then their Wisdom be to resist 
themselves for a Space, as Water heaped up by a Dam 
gathereth Force, and Hunger feedeth upon Abstinence? 
Also, there is that which I have written in a former 
Chapter of the right Use of Discipline ; and thirdly, this 
Free Flowing is without Subtility of Art, as it were an 
Harlot that plucketh Men by the Sleeve. 
195 
DE HOC MODO DISSOLUTIO 
WEE therefore will I write down the Answer to this 
nIndictment of our Wisdom, that every Act of Will is 
to be made in its Perfection, which State is to be attained 
according to these Conditions first, those of its own 
Law; second, those of its Environment. Judge thine 
own Case individually, each as it pleadeth ; for there is 
no Canon or Code, since every Star hath its own Law 
diverse from every other. Now there is the Restraint of 
Conflict, which is Impotence and Disruption; but the 
Restraint of Discipline is a Fortification of the Will by 
Repose and by Preparation, as a Conqueror resteth his 
Armies, and feedeth them and looketh to their Furniture 
and to their Spirit, before he joineth the Battle. Also, 
there is the Restraint of Art, which includeth that other 
of Discipline, and its Nature is to adorn the Will and to 
admire its Strength and its Beauty, and to enjoy its Vic-
tory by Anticipation in full Confidence, not fearful of 
Time that robbeth them that are ignorant concerning 
him, how he is but Mirage and Illusion, incapable to be-
siege the Fortress of the Soul. Work thou thy Will, 
knowing (as I said aforetime by the Mouth of Eliphaz 
Levi Zahed), thyself Omnipotent, and thine Habitation 
Eternity. 0 my Son, attend well this Word, for it is an 
Heirloom, and a Ring of Ruby and Emerald in thine In-
heritance. 
196 
DE COMOEDIA QUAE ELAN DICITUR 
sUBTLER than the Serpent of Hermes, o my Son, is this 
Way of the Restraint of Art, and thou shalt meet 
therein with the God Pan, and have him to thy Playmate. 
So shalt thou devise Comedy and Tragedy, as it were Set-
tings for the Jewel of thy Will, to enhance the Beauty 
thereof, and to refine thy Pleasures. This is that which 
is written in the Book of the Law • "Wisdom says: be 
strong! Then canst thou bear more joy. Be not animal; 
refine thy rapture! If thou drink, drink by the eight and 
ninety rules of art; if thou love, exceed by delicacy; 
d if thou do aught joyous, let there be subtlety therein. 
But exceed! exceed!" Thus thou mayst even toy with thy 
tamed Devil of Sin, and use the Pain thereof to sharpen 
the Taste of thy Meat, being Adult, and thy Tongue keen 
to the Olive, and cloyed by the Sweet, while a Child is 
opposite to this in his Preference; or as a skilled Match 
of Love aboundeth in Pinchings, Slappings, Bitings and 
the like, to intensify the Bout and to prolong it. But this 
is Risk and Peril, unless thou be wholly Master, One in 
thy Will; for there is Poison in these dead Snakes, to 
destroy thee if thou lend them of thy Life by so little as 
one Doubt of thyself, as a Seed of Division. 
197 
DE LUDO AMORIS 
IN this Mystery of the Restraint of Art is also the Secret 
of Illusion. Why, sayst thou, hath not our Lady Nuit 
her Will of Her Lord Hadit, and He of Her, and so all 
ended? But this is the Play of Her Love, that She veileth 
Her Beauty in the Robe of Illusion many-coloured, and 
evadeth Him in Sport, yea, and divorceth Him from the 
Embrace, weaving new Modesties and Allurements in 
Her Dance. Now, o my Son, the full Comprehension of 
this Arcanum is the Fruit of Contemplation, if this be 
prepared by the Experience of this Art in thine own Case. 
But to them that understand not, and have Grief of Sepa-
ration, being deceived by this Play so that they deem it 
the Division of Hate, She can but speak in Simplicity by 
that Word written in the Book of the Law: "To me !" 
For until thou love, the Play of Love is but Emptiness; 
and its Cruelty is cruel indeed, except thou know it to be 
but a Sauce to whet Appetite, and to give Emphasis of 
Contrast, as a Painter limneth the Light by Cunning of 
his Shadows. But all this Delight that thou mayst have 
of the Universe both in its Veils and in its Nakedness is 
a Reward of thine Attainment of Truth, and followeth 
after it. Nor canst thou comprehend this Doctrine by 
Mind, for the Division in thee erieth aloud in its Agony, 
denying it, unless thou be wholly Initiate. 
198 
DE GAUDIO STUPRI 
n MY Son, this Sin itself that is our Disease is but Mis- 
understanding of that Art of the Love of Our Lady 
Nuit, Yea, verily, it is all a Trick of Her Wit, and a 
Device of Her Delight, that Sin should appear, and also 
(mark thou well!) the Misapprehension of its Nature. 
Therefore the Pain of any Sinner in his Division and his 
Separation is to Her a little Spasm of Pleasure. But as 
for him, let him apprehend this Doctrine, and dissolve 
himself in Her Love. Thou then, being Initiate and Illu-
minated in this Truth, mayst accept thine own Sorrow, or 
rather that of thy Vehicle, as Lackey to the Joy that thou 
hast in thy True Self, the Star among the Stars of Her 
/Body. The Adept of this our Art is not compassionate 
concerning Sin, in his own Vehicle or another's, unless 
the Healing thereof be proper to his Will, for he is aware 
of the whole Truth of the Matter. So goeth he upon his 
Way, and tighteneth not a Rein upon the Stallions of the 
Universe, but is content, beholding the Speed of their 
Course. Verily, o my Son, it is well written in the Book 
of the Magus that it is the Curse of my Grade that I must 
needs preach my Law unto Men. For I am afflicted in 
my Tabernacle on this Count, but in my Self I rejoice, and 
join in the Laughter of Her Love. 
199 
DE CAECITIA PHILOSOPHORUM 
ANTIQUORUM 
BEHOLD, how comfortable is this my Wisdom, wherein 
I have resolved every Conflict soever that is or that 
can be, even in all Dimensions, that Antagonism of Things 
no less than their Limitations. I have said: Evil, be 
thou my Good; for it is the Magical Mirror of our Astarte, 
and the Caduceus of our Hermes. Now this was the Er-
ror of Elder Philosophers, that perceiving Changeful 
Duality as the Cause of Sorrow, they sought the Recon-
cilement in Unity and in Stability. But I shew thee the 
Universe as the Body of Our Lady Nuit, who is None 
and Two, with Hadit Her Lord as the Alternator of 
those Phases. This Universe is then a perpetual By-
coming, the Vessel of every Permutation of Infinity, 
wherein every Phenomenon is a Sacrament, Change being 
the Act of Love, and Duality the Condition prodromal to 
that Act, even as an Axe must be taken back from a Cedar 
that it may deliver its Stroke. The Error therefore of 
these Philosophers lay in their false Assumption that 
Bliss, Knowledge, and Being (the Qualities of their 
Changeless Unity) could be States. 0 my Son, how pitiful 
is their Beggary, these Paupers of Sense and of Experience 
and of Observation! The Emptiness of their Bellies was 
it that bred Phantoms of Ideal, so that they sought Joy 
by a Crude Denial of what Truth (or rather, Fact) they 
had perceived concerning the Universe, so that they set 
up an Idol of Death for their God,  in very Rage of Hatred 
against the Sum of their own Selves. 
200 
DE HERESIA MANICHAEA 
THESE Philosophers, or shall I not say Misosophers and 
Pseudo-Sophists, have been hard put to it to explain 
the Mystery of the Existence of their Evil. They have 
cried, frothing with Words, that Evil is Illusion. But if 
so, that Illusion is Evil; whence came it, and to what 
End? If their Devil created it, who created that Devil ? 
All their Contention resolveth to this Dilemma of Change 
in a Changeless, Falsity in a True, Hate in a Loving, 
Weakness in an Almighty, Duality in a Simple, Being as 
they define their God. Nor do they see that they restrict 
their God (whom yet they would have to be All) by ad-
mitting Opposites to his Nature, even when they sum 
these Opposites as Illusion, since Illusion is the Denial 
of his Truth. But the Indians, seeing this, seek Escape 
by denying all Quality soever to their God, or True State, 
I speak of Parabrahman and of Nibbana, thus in any 
Reality of Thought rather denying Him or It than destroy-
ing Illusion. But in our Light we have no need of any 
Denial, and accept All, yea, Illusion itself, discriminating 
only in our Minds between Phenomena by Comparison 
with some convenient Standard, for the Purpose of 
maintaining the Order of our Conceptions in Respect of 
the Relation of any Being with its Environment. 
201 
DE VERITATE CORUM MENSURANDA 
so do thou apprehend this Wisdom, o my Son, laying it 
to thine Heart, as a Mistress, and hiding it in the Treas-
ury of thy Mind as a Jewel of Enlightenment. Consider 
a Dream, how it is unreal in Respect of thine Experience 
of the Objects of thy waking Sense, but real also, both as 
it did in Fact impress thy Mind, and as it did express in 
arcane Token some Lust of thine Angel, as I have already 
shewed in this Letter. Consider the Play of the Chess, 
how its Law hath made for itself a Language and a Liter-
ature, yet it is but an arbitrary Invention, without im-
pinging (save as it operateth through Pleasure and Inter-
est upon Minds) on any other Sphere soever of the Uni-
verse. Equally, Things called (vulgarly) Real and Ma-
terial exist in the Universe of our Consciousness only by 
the Apprehension of their Images in Mind through Sense; 
as, how is Colour Real or Material to a blind Man; or a 
Law mathematical true to him that is imbecile or dement-
ed. All Things therefore, even if unreal and irrational, 
nay, inconceivable and impossible (such as Iota in the 
Theorem of De Moivre), exist in one Form or another; 
but the Reality of any, though in itself absolute, is in 
Regard of its Relation with any other Thing dependent 
upon the Intercourse and Language between them, 
conscious or unconscious. Consider Azote, that hath nigh 
Four Parts in Five of the Air, how it is not real to direct 
Perception of any human Sense, but yet most real to 
our Lungs, diluting the Oxygen, by whose Love we were 
else violently combust. This is the Measure of Reality.

DE APHORISMO UBI DICO : OMNIA STINT 
MY Son, long did I await thee, yearning, and with Pride 
and great Gladness did I bid thee Welcome to my 
City of the Pyramids, under the Night of Pan. Now then 
in my dear Love of thee will I reveal this Secret of Wis-
dom, which I wrote occultly in my last Chapter, in these 
Words: All Things Exist. Considered by Right Under-
standing, this is to deny that there is any Thing imagin-
able or unimaginable which doth not exist. That is, the 
Body of Our Lady Null hath no Limit, and there is no 
Void that She filleth not with the Variety and Beauty of 
Her Stars in Her Space. Nor is there any one Law of 
Her Nature, but in Her are all Laws, so that each Thing 
or each Truth that thou perceivest is as it were one Ges-
ture of Her Dance. Shut up the Book of thy Questions, o 
my Son, concerning Nature, her Way, her Origin, or her 
Purpose, except in those Matters which concern thee and 
thine own Orbit, o thou Star, begotten of my Loins in my 
Lust of Hilarion, the Golden Rose, mystic and joyous, the 
Lily of a Thousand Petals and One Petal, subtle and per-
verse, that thou mightest fulfil this Work of a Magus 
which I came to accomplish, robing myself in Flesh of 
Man, as was my Nature and the Will of my Nature, the 
Name of my Star that flameth in the Body of Nuit Our 
Lady. 
203 
DE RATIONE HUJUS EPISTOLAE SCRIBENDAE 
BEHOLD, I draw unto the End of this Discourse of 
Wisdom, as a Ship that hath adventured upon Ocean, 
from whose Mast the Watcher espieth in the Dimness of 
the Horizon a Point of Snow, being the Peak of a Great 
Mountain that is Guardian of the Harbour, the Term of 
that Voyage. So now do I commit thee wholly unto thy-
self, for I exist not in thine Universe save in my Relation 
with thee ; wherefore that Part of me is in Truth thou 
rather than I. Yet do thou treasure this Letter, for it is 
mine Especial Gift, and hath Radiance of the Light of my 
Wisdom, and flameth, being the Blood of my Love of thee 
and of Mankind. Also, it is as the Pulse of my Life, beat-
ing with the Nature thereof ; and it is the Word of my 
Will, the Charter of the Liberty of my Soul, and thine, 
and that of every Man and every Woman; for we are 
Stars. 0 my Son, for many Days was I silent, until thou 
wast fearful lest thou hadst, in Ignorance or by Inad-
vertence, enkindled the Fire of my Wrath. But I spake 
not, because I knew in my Wisdom that thou must pass 
a certain Ordeal of thine Initiation by thine own Virtue. 
For this Cause I held aloof; but in my Love I made a 
Beginning of this Letter, beholding thy Triumph afore-
hand, and with Prescience, divining thy next Need, that 
is to say, this Book of the Words of my Wisdom. 
204 
DE NATURA HUJUS EPISTOLAE 
n  MY Son, in this Letter have I written the Name of my 
own Nature, its Law, its Quality, its Will, and its Ap-
purtenance or Ornament. For it is the Child of my Love 
toward thee, and the Expression through mine Art of my 
Will so far as that regardeth thee. Now every Child is 
made of the Essence of his Father, so that every Creation 
is a Likeness or Image of the Creator, but modified by 
the Mother, that is to say, the Material whereon he be-
getteth it. So then this Letter is a Projection of mine 
own Star in a Mirror, to wit, mine Idea in thy Regard; 
and it shall be unto thee as a clear Vision of thy Father, 
and of the Word of the Aeon that he hath uttered unto 
Man. But also, because this Word is the Formula of the 
Aeon, that is to say the Law of its Changes or Phenomena, 
the Equation that expresseth its Energy and its Motion. 
it shall serve every Man in his Measure as a Text-Book 
or Comment upon the Theorick and Praxis of Magick. 
By it may he discover his own Nature, and its Will, and 
apply his Force and his Intelligence to the Right Fulfil-
ment thereof. It shall be a Beacon to enlighten him, to 
comfort him, and to direct him; and it shall be a Witness 
and Memorial of my Word and of my Work, as of mine 
Attainment unto Wisdom. 
205 
DE MODO QUO HANC EPISTOLAM SCRIPSI 
THERE is not one Word in this Letter that is not writ 
with mine own Hand and Style, slowly and heedfully 
(as is contrary with my Custom), being the Fruit of the 
Tree of my Meditation, well-ripened by the Sun of mine 
Illumination. With much Toil have I done this, being 
oftentimes seated without Motion save of the Hands, while 
Earth rolled in Shadow from Twilight unto Twilight, so 
that my Body became cold and rigid, even as is a Corpse. 
Also, in the Intervals of this Scripture, have I been given 
to Contemplation and to Works of High Magick, notably 
the Mass of the Holy Ghost, in the Concentration of my 
Will to impart this Wisdom unto thee, and to reveal the 
Mysteries of Truth. Now of all these this is the Root, 
that Truth is not fixed with the Rigour of Death, but 
vital with Lust of Change, and enflamed with the Love 
of its Opposite. Thus even Falsehood is not alien to 
Truth, for the Perfection of Nature comprehendeth All. 
But all these Things are written in the Book of the Law, 
after which do I limp painfully, afar off, upon the poor 
Crutch of mine Understanding of its Word; yea, I am well 
assured that in that Book are writ All Things soever ; 
but we, being mostly without Wit, are not able to distin-
guish them. For the Stature of Aiwass is beyond our 
Measure, seeing that He was able to comprehend the 
whole Mystery of Nuit and of Hadit, and yet to declare 
Their Message in the Languagie of Men. 
206 
DE SAPIENTIA ET STTJLTITIA 
o MY Son, in this the Colophon of mine Epistle will I 
recall the Title and Superscription thereof ; that is, 
the Book of Wisdom or Folly. I proclaim Blessing and 
Worship unto Nuit Our Lady and Her Lord Hadit, for 
the Miracle of the Anatomy of the Child Ra-Hoor-Khuit, 
as it is shewed in the Design Minutum Mundum, the Tree 
of Life. For though Wisdom be the Second Emanation 
of His Essence, there is a Path to separate and to join 
them, the Reference thereof being Aleph, that is One 
indeed, but also an Hundred and Eleven in his full Orthog-
raphy; to signify the Most Holy Trinity, and by Meta-
thesis it is Thick Darkness, and Sudden Death. This is 
also the Number of AUM, which is AMOUN, and the 
Root-Sound of OMNE, or, in Greek, PAN, and it is a 
Number of the Sun. Yet is the Atu of Thoth that corres-
pondeth thereunto marked with ZERO, and its Name is 
MAT, whereof I have spoken formerly, and its Image is 
The Fool. 0 my Son, gather thou all these Limbs to-
gether into one Body, and breathe upon it with thy Spirit, 
that it may live ; then do thou embrace it with Lust ot 
thy Manhood, and go in unto it, and know it ; so shall ye 
be One Flesh. Now at last in the Reinforcement and 
Ecstasy of this Consummation thou shalt wit by what 
Inspiration thou didst choose thy Name in the Gnosis, I 
mean PARZIVAL, "der reine Thor", the True Knight 
that won Kingship in Monsalvat, and made whole the 
Wound of Amfortas, and ordered Kumlry to Right Serv-
ice, and regained the Lance, and revived the Miracle of 
the Sangraal ; yea, also upon himself did he accomplish 
his Work in the End: "Hoechsten Heiles Wunder! Er-
loesung dem Erloeser!" This is the last Vord of the Song 
that thine Uncle Richard Wagner made for Worship of 
this Mystery. Understand thou this, o my Son, as I take 
Leave of thee in this Epistle, that the Summit of Wisdom 
is the Opening of the Way that leadeth unto the Crown 
and Essence of all, to the Soul of the Child Horus, the 
Lord of the Aeon. This Way is the Path of the Pure Fool. 
207 
DE ORACULO SUMMO 
AND who is this Pure Fool? Lo, in the Sagas of old 
Time, Legend of Scald, of Bard, of Druid, cometh he 
not in Green like Spring? 0 thou Great Fool, thou 
Water that art Air, in whom all Complex is resolved! 
Yea, Thou in ragged Raiment, with the Staff of Priapus 
and the Wineskin ! Thou standest up on the Crocodile 
like Hoor-pa-Kraat; and the Great Cat leapeth upon 
Thee! Yea, and more also, I have known Thee who Thou 
art, Bacchus Diphues, none and two, in thy Name IAO! 
Now at the End of all do I come to the Being of Thee, 
beyond By-coming, and I cry aloud My Word, as it was 
given unto Man by thine Uncle Alcofribas Nasier, the 
Oracle of the Bottle of BACBUC, and this Word is 
TRINC. 
But in the antient right Spelling this is TRINU 
whereof the Number is the Number of the Name of Me 
thy Father! to wit, Six Hundred and Three Score and Six. 
Love is the law, love under will.

A TECHNICAL NOTE CONCERNING 
DIVINATION AND LIBER ALEPH 
Qabalah, the mystical science standing at the heart of 
Crowleian Magick, is veiled on Earth in terms of pure 
mathematics. According to this veil the numbers 0-10 
contain the root formulae for creation in this Universe. 
These numbers are true symbols in that they are inter-
changeable with the thing symbolized. Every number or 
combination of numbers, then, has specific significance 
and meaning. Crowley was, of course, very aware of this 
fact and iised it accordingly. In several of his books—
most particularly Wisdom or Folly and The Book of Lies—
the information on each page stands in direct relationship 
to the number of the page itself. This makes the book 
especially susceptible to divination. 
It is understood that the petitioner creates the oracle 
and that any book can be an oracle. But here the book has 
been Magickally formulated for such a purpose and the 
"Magickal Link" is stronger and truer than with an ordi-
nary book. The oracle may be used in any number of ways. 
It may simply be opened to a page and read. A "found" 
number can be used for the divination. Another excellent 
method is to add up the numerical value of a tarot spread 
and consult that page for additional information. 
Liber Aleph, The Book of Wisdom or Folly, is a book of 
practical information. Any way you use it is for the good 
of All.
