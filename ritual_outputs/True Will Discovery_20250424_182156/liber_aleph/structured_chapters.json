    "content": "ON THE LAST ORACLE \nxii \nLIBER ALEPH VEL CXI \nAPOLOGIA \nIHAVE begotten thee, o my Son, and that strangely, as \nthou knowest, upon the Scarlet Woman called Hilarion, \nas it was mysteriously foretold unto me in the Book of the \nLaw. Now therefore that thou art come to the Age of Un-\nderstanding, do thou give ear unto my Wisdom, for that \ntherein lieth a simple and a direct Way for every Man that \nhe may attain to the End. Firstly, then, I would have thee to know that Spiritual \nExperience and Perfection have no necessary Connexion \nwith Advancement in our Holy Order. But for each Man \nis a Path: there is a Constant, and there is a Variable. Seek ever therefore in thy Work of the Promulgation of \nthe Law to discover in each Man his own true Nature. For in each Man his Inmost Light is the Core of his Star, \nthat is, Hadit; and his Work is the Identification of himself \nwith that Light. It is not every Man who is called to the sublime Task \nof the A.\u2022. A.\u2022., wherein he must master thoroughly every \nDetail of the Great Work, so that he may in due Season \naccomplish it not only for himself, but for all who are \nbound unto him. There are very many for whom in their \npresent Incarnations this Great Work may be impossible; \nsince their appointed Work may be in Satisfaction of some \nMagical Debt, or in Adjustment of some Balance, or in \nFulfilment of some Defect. As it is written: Suum Cuique. Now because thou art the Child of my Bowels I yearn \ngreatly toward thee, o my Son, and I strive strongly with \nmy Spirit that by my Wisdom I may make plain thy \nWay before Thee; and thus in many Chapters will I write \nfor thee those Things that may profit thee. Sis bene-\ndictus. 1 \nDE ARTE KABBALISTICA \nDO thou study most constantly, my Son, in the Art of the \nHoly Qabalah. Know that herein the Relations be-\ntween Numbers, though they be mighty in Power and \nprodigal of Knowledge, are but lesser Things. For the \nWork is to reduce all other Conceptions to these of Num-\nber, because thus thou wilt lay bare the very Structure of \nthy Mind, whose rule is Necessity rather than Prejudice. Not until the Universe is thus laid naked before thee canst \nthou truly anatomize it. The Tendencies of thy Mind lie \ndeeper far than any Thought, for they are the Conditions \nand the Laws of Thought; and it is these that thou must \nbring to Naught. This Way is most sure; most sacred; and the Enemies \nthereof most awful, most sublime. It is for the Great Souls \nto enter on this Rigour and Austerity; to Them the Gods \nthemselves do Homage; for it is the Way of Utmost \nPurity. 2 \nDE VITA CORRIGENDA \nKNOW' Son, that the true Principle of Self-control is \nLiberty. For we are born into a World which is in \nBondage to Ideals; to them we are perforce fitted, even \nas his Enemies to the Bed of Procrustes. Each of us, as \nhe groweth, learns Repression of himself and his true \nWill, \"It is a lie, this folly against self\": these Words are \nwritten in the Book of the Law. So therefore those Pas-\nsions in ourselves which we understand to be Hindrances \nare nor Art nor Part of our True Will, but diseased Ap-\npetites, manifest in us through false early Training. Thus \nthe Tabus of savage Tribes in such a matter as Love \nconstrain that True Love which is born in us; and by \nthis Constraint come Ills of Body and Mind. Either the \nForce of Repression carries it, and creates Neuroses and \nInsanities; or the Revolt against that Force, breaking \nforth with Violence, involves Excesses and Extravagan-\nces. All these Things are Disorders, and against Nature. Now then learn of me the Testimony of History and Lit-\nerature, as a great Scroll of Learning. But the Vellum \nof the Scroll is of Man's Skin, and its Ink of his Heart's \nBlood. 3 \nLEGENDA DE AMORE \nTHE Fault, that is Fatality, in Love, as in every other \nForm of Will, is Impurity. It is not the Spontaneity \nthereof which worketh Woe, but some Repression in the \nEnvironment. In the Fable of Adam and Eve is this great Lesson \ntaught by the Masters of the Holy Qabalah. For Love \nwere to them the eternal Eden, save for the Repression \nsignified by the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Thus their Nature of Love was perfect; it was their Fall \nfrom that Innocence which drove them from the Garden. In the Love of Romeo and Juliet was no Flaw; but fam-\nily Feud, which imported nothing to that Love, was its \nBane; and the Rashness and Violence of their Revolt \nagainst that Repression, slew them. In the pure Outrush of natural Love in Desdemona for \nOthello was no Flaw; but his Love was marred by his \nConsciousness of his Age and of his Race, of the Preju-\ndices of his Fellows and of his own Experience of \nWoman-frailty. 4 \nGESTA DE AMORE \nNOW as Literature overfloweth with the Murders of \nLove, so also doth History, and the Lesson is ever \nthe same. Thus the Loves of Abelard and of Heloise were des-\ntroyed by the System of Repression in which they \nchanced to move. Thus Beatrice was robbed of Dante by social Artificial-\nities and Paolo slain on account of Things external to \nhis Love for Francesca. Then, per contra, Martin Luther, being a Giant of Will, \nand also the Eighth Henry of England, as a mighty King, \nbent them to overturn the whole World that they might \nhave satisfaction of their Loves. And who shall follow them? For even now we find \ngreat Churchmen, Statesmen, Princes, Dramamakers, and \nmany lesser Men, overwhelmed utterly and ruined by \nthe Conflict between their Passions and the Society about \nthem. Wherein which Party errs is no matter of Moment \nfor our Thought ; but the Existence of that War is Evi-\ndence of Wrong done to Nature. 5 \nULTIMA THESIS DE AMORE \nTHEREFORE, o my Son, be thou wary, not bowing be-\nfore the false Idols and Ideals, yet not flaming forth \nin Fury against them, unless that be thy Will. But in this Matter be prudent and be silent, discerning \nsubtly and with Acumen the nature of the Will within \nthee ; so that thou mistake not Fear for Chastity, or An-\nger for Courage. And since the Fetters are old and heavy, \nand thy Limbs withered and distorted by reason of their \nCompulsion, do thou, having broken them, walk gently \nfor a little while, until the ancient Elasticity return, so \nthat thou mayst walk, run, and leap naturally and with \nRejoicing. Also, since these Fetters are as a Bond almost univer-\nsal, be instant to declare the Law of Liberty, and the full \nknowledge of all Truth that appertaineth to this Matter ; \nfor if in this only thou overcome, then shall all Earth be \nfree, taking its Pleasure in Sunlight without Fear or \nPhrenzy. Amen. 6 \nDE NATURA SUA PERCIPIENDA \nINDERSTAND, o my Son, in thy Youth, these Words \nwhich some wise One, now nameless spake of old: \nexcept ye become as little Children, ye shall in no wise \nenter into the Kingdom of Heaven. This is to say that \nthou must first comprehend thine original Nature in \nevery Point, as it was before thou wast forced to bow \nbefore the Gods of Wood and Stone that Men have made, \nnot comprehending the Law of Change, and of Evolution \nThrough Variation, and the independent Value of every \nLiving Soul. Learn this also, that even the Will to the Great Work \nmay be misunderstood of Men ; for this Work must pro-\nceed naturally and without Overstress, as all true Works. Right also is that Word that the Kingdom of Heaven suf-\nfereth Violence, and the violent take it by Force. But ex-\ncept filial be violent by Virtue of thy true Nature, how \nshalt thou take it? Be not as the Ass in the Lion's Skin; \nbut if thou be born Ass, bear patiently thy Burdens and \nenjoy thy Thistles; for an Ass also, as in the Fables of \nApuleius and of Matthias, may come to glory in the Path \nof his own Virtue.

    "title": "7 \nALTERA DE VIA NATURAE.",
    "content": "SAYEST thou (methinks) that here is a great Riddle, \nsince by Reason of much Repression thou hast lost the \nKnowledge of thine original Nature? My Son, this is not so ; for by a peculiar Ordinance of \nHeaven, and a Disposition occult within his Mind, ig \nevery man protected from this Loss of his own Soul, until \nand unless he be by Choronzon disintegrated and dis-\npersed beyond power of Will to repair, as when the \nConflict within him, rending and burning, hath made his \nMind utterly Desert, and his Soul Madness. Give Ear, give Ear attentively; the Will is not lost, \nthough it be buried beneath a life-old Midden of Repres-\nsions ; for it persisteth vital within thee (is it not the true \nMotion of thine inmost Being ?) and for all thy conscious \nStriving, cometh forth by Night and by Stealth in Dream \nand Phantasy. Now is it naked and brilliant, now clothed \nin rich Robes of Symbol and Hieroglyph; but alway tray-\nelleth it with thee upon thy Path, ready to acquaint thee \nwith thy true Nature, if thou attend unto its Word, -  its \nGesture, or its Show of Imagery. 8 \nQUO MODO NATURA SUA EST LFGENDA \nDEEM not therefore that thy lightest Fancy is witless : \nit is a Word to thee, a Prophecy, a Sign or Signal \nfrom thy Lord. Thy most unconscious Acts are Keys to \nthe Treasure-Chamber of thine own Palace, which is the \nHouse of the Holy Ghost. Consider well thy conscious \nThoughts and Acts, for they are under the Dominion of thy \nWill, and moved in Accord with the Operation of thy Rea-\nson ; this indeed is a necessary Work, enabling thee to \ncomprehend in what manner thou mayst adjust thyself \nto thine Environment. Yet is this Adaptation but Defence \nfor the most Part, or at the best Subterfuge and Strata-\ngem in the Tactics of thy Life, with but an accidental and \nsubordinate Relation to thy true Will, whereof by Cons-\nciousness and by Reason thou mayst be ignorant, unless \nby Fortune great and rare thou be already harmonized \nin thyself, the Outer with the Inner, which Grace is not \ncommon among Men, and is the Reward of previous At-\ntainment. Neglect not simple Introspection, therefore, but give \nyet greater heed unto those Dreams and Phantasies, those \nGestures and Manners unconscious, and of undiscovered \nCause, which betoken thee. 9 \nDE SOMNIIS a) Causa per Accidens \nAS all Diseases have two conjunct Causes, one imme- \ndiate, external and exciting, the other constitutional, \ninternal, and predisposing, so it is with Dreams, which \nare Dig-Eases, or unbalanced States, of Consciousness, \nDisturbers of Sleep as Thoughts are of Life. This exciting Cause is commonly of two kinds : vide-\nlicet, imprimis, the physical Conditon of the Sleeper, as \na Dream of Water caused by a Shower without, or a \nDream of Strangulation caused by a Dyspnoea, or a \nDream of Lust caused by the seminal Congestions of an \nunclean Life, or a Dream of falling or flying caused by \nsome unstable Equilibrium of his Body. Secundo, the psychical Condition of the Sleeper, the \nDream being determined by recent Events in his Life, \nusually those of the Day previous, and especially such \nEvents as have caused Excitement or Anxiety, the more \nso if they be unfinished or unfulfilled. But this exciting Cause is of a superficial Nature, as it \nwere a Cloke or a Mask; and thus it but lendeth Aspect \nto the other Cause, which lieth in the Nature of the Sleep-\ner himself. 10 \nDE SOMNIIS b) Causa per Naturam \nTHE deep, constitutional, or predisposing Cause of \nDreams Beth within the Jurisdiction of the Will itself. For that Will, being alway present, albeit (it may be) la-\ntent, discovereth himself when no longer inhibited by \nthat conscious Control which is determined by Environ-\nment, and therefore oft times contrary to himself. This \nbeing so, the Will declareth himself, as it were in a Pag-\neant, and sheweth himself thus apparelled, unto the \nSleeper, for a Warning or Admonition. Every Dream, or \nPageant of Fancy, is therefore a Shew of Will ; and Will \nbeing no more prevented by Environment or by Cons-\nciousness, cometh as a Conqueror. Yet even so he must \ncome for the most Part throned upon the Chariot of the \nExciting Cause of the Dream, and therefore is his Ap-\npearance symbolic, like a Writing in Cipher, or like a \nFable, or like a Riddle in Pictures. But alway doth he \ntriumph and fulfil himself therein, for the Dream is a \nnatural Compensation in the inner World for any Failure \nof Achievement in the outer. 11 \nDE SOMNIIS c) Vestimenta horroris \nNOW then if in a Dream the Will be alway triumphant, \nhow cometh it that a Man may be ridden of the \nNightmare ? And of this the true Explanation is that in \nsuch a case the Will is in Danger, having been attacked \nand wounded, or corrupted by the Violence of some Re-\npression. Thus the Consciousness of the Will is directed \nto the sore Spot, as in Pain, and seeketh Comfort in an \nExternalization, or Shew, of that Antagonism. And be-\ncause the Will is sacred, such Dreams excite an Ecstasy \nor Phrenzy of Horror, Fear, or Disgust. Thus the true \nWill of Oedipus was toward the Bed of Jocasta, but the \nTabu, strong both by Inheritance and by Environment, \nwas so attached to that Will that his Dream concerning \nhis Destiny was a Dream of Fear and of Abhorrence, his \nFulfilment thereof (even in Ignorance) a Spell to stir up \nall the subconscious Forces of all the People about him, \nand his Realization of the Act a Madness potent to drive \nhim to self-inflicted Blindness and fury-haunted Exile. 12 \nDE SOMNIIS d) Sequentia \nKNOW firmly, o my Son, that the true Will cannot err; \nfor it is thine appointed Course in Heaven, in whose \nOrder is Perfection. A Dream of Horror is therefore the most serious of all \nWarnings ; for it signifieth that thy Will, which is Thy \nSelf in respect of its Motion, is in Affliction and Danger. Thus thou must instantly seek out the Cause of that sub-\nconscious Conflict, and destroy thine Enemy utterly by \nbringing thy conscious Vigour as an Ally to that true \nWill. If then there be a Traitor in that Consciousness, \nhow much the more is it necessary for thee to arise and \nextirpate him before he wholly infect thee with the di-\nvided Purpose which is the first Breach in that Fortress \nof the Soul whose Fall should bring it to that shapeless \nRuin whose Name is Choronzon ! 13 \nDE SOMNIIS e) Clavicula \nTHE Dream delightful is then a Pageant of the Fulfil- \nment of the true Will and the Nightmare a symbolic \nBattle between it and its Assailants in thyself. But there \ncan be only one true Will, even as there can be only one \nproper Motion in any Body, no Matter of how many Forces \nthat Motion be the Resultant. Seek therefore this Will, \nand conjoin with it thy conscious Self ; for this is that \nwhich is written: \"thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that, and no other shall say nay.\" Thou seest, o my Son, \nthat all conscious Opposition to thy Will, whether in Igno-\nrance, or by Obstinacy, or through Fear of others, may in \nthe End endanger even thy true Self, and bring thy Star \ninto Disaster. And this is the true Key to Dreams \u2022 see that thou be \ndiligent in its Use, and unlock therewith the secret \nChambers of thine Heart. '14 \nDE VIA PER EMPYRAEUM \nCONCERNING thy Travellings in the Body of Light, or \nAstral Journeys and Visions so-called, do thou lay this \nWisdom to thine Heart, o my Son, that in this Practice, \nwhether Things Seen and Heard be Truth and Reality, or \nwhether they be Phantoms in the Mind, abideth this su-\npreme Magical Value, namely : Whereas the Direction of \nsuch Journeys is consciously willed, and determined by \nReason, and also unconsciously willed, by the true Self, \nsince without It no Invocation were possible, we have here \na Cooperation or Alliance between the Inner and the Outer \nSelf, and thus an Accomplishment, at least partial, of the \nGreat Work. And therefore is Confusion or Terror in any such Prac-\ntice an Error fearful indeed, bringing about Obsession, \nwhich is a temporary or even it may be a permanent Di-\nvision of the Personality, or Insanity, and therefore a De-\nfeat most fatal and pernicious, a Surrender of the Soul to \nChnrnnz011. 15 \nDE CULTU \nNOW, o my Son, that thou mayst be well guarded against \nthy ghostly Enemies, do thou work constantly by the \nMeans prescribed in our Holy Books. Neglect never the fourfold Adorations of the Sun in his \nfour Stations, for thereby thou dost affirm thy Place in \nNature and her Harmonies. Neglect not the Performance of the Ritual of the Pen-\ntagram, and of the Assumption of the Form of Hoor-pa-\nKraat. Neglect not the daily Miracle of the Mass, either by \nthe rite of the Gnostic Catholic Church, or that of the \nPhoenix. Neglect not the performance of the Mass of the Holy \nGhost, as Nature Herself prompteth thee. Travel much also in the Empyrean in thy Body of Light, \nseeking ever Abodes more fiery and lucid. Finally, exercise constantly the Eight Limbs of Yoga. And so shalt thou come to the End \n16 \nDE CLAVICULA SOMNIORUM \nAND now concerning Meditation let me disclose unto \nthee more fully the Mystery of the Key of Dreams and \nPhantasies. Learn first that as the thought of the Mind standeth \nbefore the Soul and hindereth its Manifestation in Con-\nsciousness, so also the gross physical Will is the Creator \nof the Dreams of common Men. And as in Meditation \nthou dost destroy every Thought by mating it with its \nOpposite, so must thou cleanse thyself by a full and per-\nfect Satisfaction of that bodily Will in the Way of Chas-\ntity and Holiness which hath been revealed unto thee in \nthine Initiation. This inner Silence of the body being attained, it may \nbe that the True Will may speak in True Dreams ; for it \nis written that He giveth unto His beloved in Sleep. Prepare thyself therefore in this Way, as a good Knight \nshould de. 17 \nDE SOMNO LUCIDO \nNow know this also, that at the End of that secret Way \nlieth a Garden wherein is a Rest House prepared for \nthee. For to him whose physical Needs (of whatsoever kind) \nare not truly satisfied cometh a physical or lunar Sleep \nappointed to refresh and recreate by Cleansing and Re-\npose ; but on him that is bodily pure the Lord bestoweth \na solar or lucid Sleep, wherein move Images of pure Light \nfashioned by the True Will. And this is called by the Qa-\nbalists the Sleep of Shiloam, and of this doth also Por-\nphyry make mention, and Cicero, with many other Wise \nMen of Old Time. Compare, o my Son, with this Doctrine that which was \ntaught thee in the Sanctuary of the Gnosis concerning the \nDeath of the Righteous; and learn moreover that these \nare but particular Cases of an Universal Formula. 18 \nDE VENENIS \nMY Son, if thou fast awhile, there shall come unto thee \na second State of physiological Being, in which is a \nDelight passive and equable, without Will, a Contentment \nof Weakness, with a Feeling of Lightness and of Purity. And this is because the Blood hath absorbed, in its Need \nof Nutriment, all foreign Elements. Such also is the Case \nwith the Mind which hath not fed itself on Thought. Con-\nsider the placid and ruminant Existence of such Persons \nas read little, are removed from worldly Struggle by some \nsufficient Property of small and unexciting Value, stably \ninvested, and by Age and Environment are free from \nPassion. They live, according to their own Nature, without \nDesire, and they oppose no Resistance to the Operations \nof Time. Such are called happy; and in their Way of Veg-\netable Life it is so; for they are free of any Poison. 19 \nDE MOTU VITAE \n1\" BARN then, o my Son, that all Phenomena are the Ef- \nfect of Conflict, even as the Universe itself is a Noth-\ning expressed as the Difference of two Equalities, or, \nan thou wilt, as the Divorce of Nuit and Hadit. So there-\nfore every Marriage dissolveth a more material, and cre-\nateth a less material Complex; and this is our Way of \nLove, rising ever from Ecstasy to Ecstasy. So then all high \nViolence, that is to say, all Consciousness, is the spiritual \nOrgasm of a Passion between two lower and grosser \nOpposites. Thus Light and Heat result from the Mar ,  \nriage of Hydrogen and Oxygen, Love from that of Man \nand Woman, Dhyana or Ecstasy from that of the Ego and \nthe non-Ego. But be thou well grounded in this Thesis corollary, that \none or two such Marriages do but destroy for a Time the \nExacerbation of any Complex ; to deracinate such is a \nWork of long Habit and deep Search in Darkness for the \nGerm thereof. But this once accomplished, that particular \nComplex is destroyed, or sublimated, for ever. 20 \nDE MORBIS SANGUINIS \nNOW then understand that all Opposition to the Way of \nNature createth Violence. If thine excretory System do \nits Function not at its fullest, there come Poisons in the \nBlood, and the Consciousness is modified by the Conflicts \nor Marriages between the Elements heterogeneous. Thus \nif the Liver be not efficient, we have Melancholy; if the \nKidneys, Coma; if the Testes or Ovaries, loss of Personal-\nity itself. Also, an we poison the Blood directly with Bel-\nladonna, we have Delirium vehement and furious; with \nHashish, Visions phantastic and enormous; with Anhalo-\nnium, Ecstasy of Colour and what not ; with divers Germs \nof Disease, Disturbances of Consciousness varying with \nthe Nature of the Germ. Also, with Ether, we gain the \nPower of analysing the Consciousness into its Planes and \neven of discovering the hidden Will and Judgment upon \nany Question ; and so for many others, \nBut all these are, in our mystical Sense, Poisons ; that \nis, we take two Things diverse and opposite, binding them \ntogether so that they are compelled to unite; and the Or-\ngasm of each Marriage is an Ecstasy, the lower dissolving \nin the higher. 21 \nDE CURSU AMORIS \nIcontinue then, o my Son, and reiterate that this Formula \nis general to all Nature. And thou wilt note that by re-\npeated Marriage cometh Toleration, so that Ecstasy ap-\npeareth no more. Thus his half grain of Morphia, which at \nfirst opened the Gates of Heaven, is nothing worth to the \nSelf-poisoner after a Year of daily Practice. So too the \nLover findeth no more Joy in Union with his Mistress, so \nsoon as the original Attraction between them is satisfied \nby repeated Conjunctions. For this Attraction is an Anta-\ngonism ; and the greater the Antinomy, the more fierce \nthe Puissance of the Magnetism, and the Quantity of \nEnergy disengaged by the Coition. Thus in the Union of \nSimilars, as of Halogens with each other, is no strong \nPassion or explosive Force ; and the Love between two \nPersons of like Character and Taste is placid and without \nTransmutation to higher Planes. 22 \nDE NUPTIIS MYSTICIS \nomy Son, how wonderful is the Wisdom of this Law of \nLove ! How vast are the Oceans of uncharted Joy that \nlie before the Keel of thy Ship ! Yet know this, that every \nOpposition is in its Nature named Sorrow, and the Joy \nlieth in the Destruction of the Dyad. Therefore, must thou \nseek ever those Things which are to thee poisonous, and \nthat in the highest Degree, and make them thine by Love. That which repels, that which disgusts, must thou assimi-\nlate in this Way of Wholeness. Yet rest not in the Joy of \nthe Destruction of every Complex in thy Nature, but \npress on to that ultimate Marriage with the Universe \nwhose Consummation shall destroy thee utterly, leaving \nonly that Nothingness which was before the Beginning. So then the Life of Non-action is not for thee ; the \nWithdrawal from Activity is not the Way of the Tao; but \nrather the Intensification and making universal of every \nUnit of thine Energy on every Plane. 23 \nDE VOLTJPTATE POENARUM \n(10 forth, o my Son, o Son of the Sun, rejoicing in thy \nStrength, as a Warrior, as a Bridegroom, to take thy \nPleasure upon the Earth, and in every Palace of the Mind, \nmoving ever from the crass to the subtle, from the coarse \nto the fine. Conquer every Repulsion in thy Self, subdue \nevery Aversion. Assimilate all Poison, for therein only is \nthere Profit. Seek constantly therefore to know what is \npainful and to cleave thereunto, for by Pain cometh true \nPleasure. Those who avoid Pain physical or mental remain \nlittle Men, and there is no Virtue in them. Yet be thou \nware lest thou fall into that Heresy which maketh Pain \nand Self-sacrifice as it were Bribes to a corrupt God, to \nsecure some future Pleasure in an imagined After-life. Nay, also, of the other Part, fear not to destroy thy Com-\nplexes, thinking dreadfully thereby to lose the Power of \ncreating Joy by their Distinction. Yet in each Marriage \nbe thou bold to affirm the spiritual Ardour of the Orgasm, \nfixing it in some Talisman, whether it be Art, or Magick, \nor Thetuty. 24 \nDE VOLUNTATE ULTIMA \nSAY not then that this Way is contrary to Nature, and \nthat in Simplicity of Satisfaction of thy Needs is Per-\nfection of thy Path. For to thee, who Ilast aspired, it is \nthy Nature to perform the Great Work, and this is the \nfinal Dissolution of the Cosmos. For though a Stone seem \nto lie still upon a Mountain Top, and have no Care, yet \nhath it an hidden Nature, a Task Ineffable and Stupen-\ndous; namely, to force its Way to the Centre of Gravity of \nthe Universe, and also to burn up its Elements into the \nfinal Homogeneity of Matter. Therefore the Way of Quiet \nis but an Illusion of Ignorance. Whoever thou mayst be \nnow, thy Destiny is that which I have declared unto thee; \nand thou art most fixed in the True Way when, accepting \nthis consciously as thy Will, thou gatherest up thy Powers \nto move thy Self mightily within it. 25 \nDE DIFFERENTIA RERUM \nBUT' o my Son although thine ultimate Nature be Uni- \nversal, thine immediate Nature is Particular. Thy \nWay to the Centre is not oriented as that of any other \nBeing, and thine Elements are not kin, but alien, to his. For Shame ! is it not the most transcendent of all the \nWisdoms of this Cosmos, that no two Beings are alike? Lo! this is the Secret of all Beauty, and maketh Love not \nonly possible, but necessary, between every Thing and \nevery other Thing. So then, lest thou in thine Ignorance \ntake some false Way, and divagate, must thou learn thine \nown particular and peculiar Nature in its Relation to all \nothers. For though it be Illusion, it is by the true Analysis \nof Falsehoods that we are able to destroy them, just as \nthe Physician must understand the Disease of his Patient \nif he is to choose the fitting Remedy. Now therefore will \nI make yet more clear unto thee the Value of thy Dreams \nand Phantasies and Gestures of thine unconscious Body \nand Mind, as Symptoms of thy particular Will, and shew \nthee how thou mayst come to their Interpretation. 26 \nDE VOLUNTATE TACITA \nALL Disturbances, o my Son, are Variations from Equi- \nlibrium; and just as thy conscious Thoughts, Words, \nand Acts are Effects of the Displacement of the conscious \nWill, so is it in the Unconscious. For the most Part, there-\nfore, all Dreams, Phantasies, and Gestures represent \nthat WiE subliminal ; and if the physical Part of that \nWill be unsatisfied, its Utterance will predominate in all \nthese automatic Expressions. Do thou then note what Mo-\ndifications thereof follow such Changes in the conscious \nFoundation of that part of thy Will as thou mayst make \nin thine Experiments therewith, and thus separate, as \nsayeth Trismegistus, the fine from the coarse, Fire from \nEarth, or, as we may say, assign each Effect to its true \nCause. Seek then to perfect a conscious Satisfaction of \nevery Part of this Will, so that the unconscious Disturb-\nances be at last brought to Silence. Then will the Resi-\nduum be as it were an Elixir clarified and perfected, a \ntrue Symbol of that other hidden Will which is the Vector \nof thy Magical Self. 27 \nDE FORMULA SUMMA \nLEARN moreover that thy Self includeth the whole Uni- \nverse of thy Knowledge, so that every Increase upon \nevery Plane is an Aggrandisement of that Self. Yet the \ngreater part of this Universe is common Knowledge, so \nthat thy Self is interwover. with other Selves, save for \nthat Part peculiar to thy Self. And as thou growest, so \nalso this peculiar Part is ever of less Proportion to the \nwhole, until when thou becomest infinite, it is a Quantity \ninfinitesimal and to be neglected. Lo ! when the All is ab-\nsorbed within the I, it is as if the I were s bsorbed within \nthe All ; for if two Things become wholly and indissolubly \nOne Thing, there is no more Reason for Names, since \nNames are given to mark off one Thing from another. And \nthis is that which is written in the Book of the Law: Let \nthere be no difference made among you between any one \nthing & any other thing; for thereby there cometh \nhurt. But whoso availeth in this, let him be the chief of all! 28 \nDE VIA INERTIAE \n11F the Way of the Tao I have already written to thee, o \nmy Son, but I must further instruct thee in this Doc-\ntrine of doing everything by doing nothing. I will first \nhave thee to understand that the Universe being as above \nsaid an Expression of Zero under the figure of the Dyad, \nits Tendency is continually to release itself from that \nStrain by the Marriage of Opposites whenever they are \nbrought into Contact. Thus thy true Nature is a Will to \nZero, or en Inertia, or Doing Nothing; and the Way of \nDoing Nothing is to oppose no Obstacle to the free Func-\ntion of that true Nature. Consider the Electrical Charge \nof a Cloud, whose Will is to discharge itself in Earth, \nand so to release the strain of its Potential. Do this by \nfree Conduction, there is Silence and Darkness; oppose it, \nthere is Heat and Light, and the Rending asunder of that \nwhich will not permit free Passage to the Current. 29 \nDE VIA LIBERTATIS \nDO not think then that by Non-action thou dost follow \nthe Way of the Tao, for thy Nature is Action, and by \nhindering the Discharge of thy Potential thou dost per-\npetuate and aggravate the Stress. If thou ease not Na- \u2022 \nture, she will bring thee to Dis-ease. Free therefore every \nFunction of thy Body and of every other Part of thee ac-\ncording to its true Will. This also is most necessary, that \nthou discover that true Will in every case, for thou art \nborn into Dis-ease, where are many false and perverted \nWills, monstrous Growths, Parasites, Vermin are they, \nadherent to thee by Vice of Heredity or of Environment \nor of evil Training. And of all these Things the subtlest \nand most terrible, Enemies without pity, destructive to \nthy Will, and a Menace and Tyranny even to thy Self, \nare the Ideals and Standards of the Slave-gods, false \nReligion, false Ethics, even false Science. 30 \nDE LEGE MOTUS \nCONSIDER, my Son, that word in the Call or Key of the \nThirty Aethyrs : Behold the Face of your God, the \nBeginning of Comfort, whose eyes are the Brightness of \nthe Heavens, which provided you for the Government of \nthe Earth, and her Unspeakable Variety ! And again: let \nthere be no Creature upon her or within her the same. All her Members let them differ in their Qualities, and \nlet there be no Creature equal with another. Here also \nis the voice of true Science, crying aloud: Variation is \nthe Key of Evolution. Thereunto Art cometh the third, \nperceiving Beauty in the Harmony of the Diverse. Know \nthen, o my Son, that all Laws, all Systems, all Customs, \nall Ideals and Standards which tend to produce Uniform-\nity, being in direct Opposition to Nature's Will to \nchange and to develop through Variety, are accursed. Do \nthou with all thy Might of Manhood strive against these \nForces, for they resist Change, which is Life; and thus \nthey are of Death. 31 \nDE LEGIBUS CONTRA MOTUM \nSAY not, in thine Haste, that such Stagnations are Unity \neven as the last Victory of thy free Will is Unity. For \nthy Will moveth through free Function, according to its \nparticular Nature, to that End of Dissolution of all Com-\nplexities, and the Ideals and Standards are Attempts to \nhalt thee on that Way. Although for thee some certain \nIdeal be upon thy Path, yet for thy Neighbour it \nmay not be so. Set all Men a-horseback ; thou speedest \nthe Foot-soldier upon his way, indeed; but what hast \nthou done to the Bird-man ? Thou must have simple Laws \nand Customs to express the general Will, and so prevent \nthe Tyranny or Violence of a few ; but multiply them not ! Now then herewith I will declare unto thee the Limits \nof the Civil Law upon the Rock of the Law of Thelema. 32 \nDE NECESSITATE COMMUNE \nUNDERSTAND first that the Disturbers of the Peace of \nMankind do so by Reason of their Ignorance of their \nown True Wills. Therefore, as this Wisdom of mine in-\ncreaseth among Mankind, the false Will to Crime must \nbecome constantly more rare. Also, the Exercise of Our \nFreedom will cause Men to be born with less and ever \nless Affliction from that Dis-ease of Spirit, which breed-\neth these false Wills. But, in the While of waiting for \nthis Perfection, thou must by Law assure to every Man \na Means of satisfying his bodily and his mental Needs, \nleaving him free to develop any Superstructure in accord-\nance with his Will, and protecting him from any that \nmay seek to deprive him of these vertebral Rights. There \nshall be therefore a Standard of Satisfaction, though it \nmust vary in Detail with Race, Climate, and other such \nConditions. And this Standard shall be based upon a large \nInterpretation of Facts biological, physiological, and the \nlike. 33 \nDE LIBERTATE CORPORIS \nTHERE shall be no Property in human Flesh. Every \nMan and every Woman hath Right Indefeasable to \ngive the Body for the Enjoyment of any other. The Exer-\ncise of that Right shall not be punished either by Law or \nby Custom ; there shall be no Penalty either by Loss or \nCurtailment of Liberty, of Rights, of Wealth, or of social \nEsteem ; but this Freedom shall be respected of all, seeing \nthat it is the Right of the bodily Will. For this same \nReason thou shalt cause full Restriction and Punishment \nof any who may seek to limit that Freedom for the sake \nof his own Profit, or Desire, or Ideal. Every Man and \nevery Woman hath full right either to grant or to deny \nthe Body, as the Will speaketh within. This being made \nCustom, the evils of Love, which are many, extending \nto the Disturbance not only of Body but of Mind, and \nthat in obscure Paths, shall little by little disappear \nfrom the Face of His unspeakable Glory. 34 \nDE LIBERTATE MENTIS \nTHERE shall be no Property in Human Thought. Let \neach think as he will concerning the Universe; but let \nnone seek to impose that Thought upon another by any \nThreat of Penalty in this World or any other World. Look \nnow, though I enkindle thee to Effort in thy Way, yet it \nis the Way of thy Will, and I say not even that thou dost \nwell to haste therein, for the whole Matter lieth in thy \nWill, and to force thyself against thy Nature would be \nan Obstacle to thy Passage. But if I urge thee to run well \nthis Race as an Athlete, it is because I have perceived in \nthy Nature that fierce Lust and mighty Concentration in \nthat Will, and I write this Letter unto thee knowing well \nthat thou wilt rejoice exceedingly therein, since it is an \nExpression of thine own Will, and it may be a Discovery \nthereof, which Thing thou vehemently seekest I charge \nthee therefore that thou permit none to tyrannize any \nother in Thought, or to threaten, or in any other wise to \nblaspheme the great Liberty of Our Father the Sun in \nthe Great Cosmos, or of His Viceregent in the Little. 35 \nDE LIBERTATE JUVENUM \nn thou that art the Child of mine own Bowels, how shall \nI write to thee concerning Children? For herein is \nthe Gordian Knot in our whole Rope of Wisdom, and it \nmay not be severed by Sword, no, not of a greater than \nAlexander the Two-Horned. And it is a Balance like that \nof the Egg, and the violence of a Columbus will but \ncrack the tender Shell which we must first of all preserve. Now Sentinel to this Fortress standeth a certain Par-\nadox of general Application and in this large Order I \nwill declare it, so that its particular Sense may enlighten \nthy Mind hereafter. And this is the Paradox, that there \nare Bonds which lead to Slavery, and Bonds which lead \nto Freedom. All we are bound in many Fetters by Envi-\nronment, and it is for ourselves in great Part to determine \nwhether they shall enslave us or emancipate us. And I \nwill make clear this Thesis to thee by the Way of Illus-\ntration. 36 \nDE VI PER DISCIPLINAM COLENDA \nCONSIDER the Bond of a cold Climate, how it maketh \nman a Slave: he must have Shelter and Food with \nfierce Toil. Yet thereby he becometh strong against the \nElements, and his moral Force waxeth, so that he is \nMaster of such Men as live in Lands of Sun where bodily \nNeeds are satisfied without Struggle. Consider also him that willeth to excel in Speed or in \nBattle, how he denieth himself the Food he craveth, and \nall Pleasures natural to him, putting himself under the \nharsh Order of a Trainer. So by this Bondage he hath, at \nthe last, his Will. Now then the one by natural, and the other by volun-\ntary, Restriction have come each to a greater Liberty. This is also a general law of Biology, for all Development \nis Structuralization ; that is, a Limitation and Speciali-\nzation of an originally indeterminate Protoplasm, which \nlatter may therefore be called free, in the definition of a \nPedant. 37 \nDE ORDINE VERUM \nIN the Body every Cell is subordinated to the general \nphysiological Control, and we who will that Control \ndo not ask whether each individual Unit of that Structure \nbe consciously happy. But we do care that each shall \nfulfil its Function, and the Failure of even a few Cells, \nor their Revolt, may involve the Death of the whole Or-\nganism. Yet even here the Complaint of a few, which \nwe call Pain, is a Warning of general Danger. Many Cells \nfulfil their Destiny by swift Death, and this being their \nFunction, they in no wise resent it. Should Haemoglobin \nresist the Attack of Oxygen, the Body would perish, and \nthe Haemoglobin would not thereby save itself. Now, o \nmy Son, do then consider deeply of these Things in thine \nOrdering of the World under the Law of Thelema. For \nevery Individual in the State must be perfect in his own \nFunction, with Contentment, respecting his own Task as \nnecessary and holy, not envious of another's. For so only \nmayst thou build up a Free State, whose directing Will \nshall be singly directed to the Welfare of all. 38 \nDE FUNDAMENTIS CIVITATIS \nSAY not, o my Son, that in this Argument I have set \nLimits to individual Freedom. For each Man in this \nState which I purpose is fulfilling his own true Will by \nhis eager Acquiescence in the Order necessary to the \nWelfare of all, and therefore of himself also. But see thou \nwell to it that thou set high the Standard of Satisfaction, \nand that to every one be a surplus of Leisure and of Ener-\ngy, so that, his Will of Self-preservation being fulfilled \nby the Performance of his Function in the State, he may \ndevote the Remainder of his Powers to the Satisfaction of \nthe other Parts of his Will. And because the People are \noft-times unlearned, not understanding Pleasure, let them \nbe instructed in the Art of Life: to prepare Food palat-\nable and wholesome, each to his own Taste, to make \nClothes according to Fancy, with Variety of Individuality, \nand to practice the manifold Crafts of Love These Things \nbeing first secured, thou mayst afterward lead them into \nthe Heavens of Poesy and Tale, of Music, Painting, and \nSculpture, and into the Lore of the Mind itself, with its \ninsatiable Joy of all Knowledge. Thence let them soar! 39 \nDE VOLITNTATE JUVENUM \nLONG, o my Son, hath been this Digression from the \nplain Path of my Word concerning Children; but it \nwas most needful that thou shouldst understand the Lim-\nits of true Liberty. For that is not the Will of any Man \nwhich ultimateth in his own Ruin and that of all his Fel-\nlows; and that is not Liberty whose Exercise bringeth \nhim to Bondage. Thou mayst therefore assume that it is \nelway an essential Part of the Will of any Child to grow \nto Manhood or to Womanhood in Health, and his Guard-\nians may therefore prevent him from ignorantly acting \nin Opposition thereunto, Care being always taken to re-\nmove the Cause of the Error, namely, Ignorance, as afore-\nsaid. Thou mayst also assume that it is Part of the \nChild's Will to train every Function of the Mind; and the \nGuardians may therefore combat the Inertia which hin-\nders its Development. Yet here is much Caution neces-\nsary, and it is better to work by exciting and satisfying \nany natural Curiosity than by forcing Application to set \nTasks, however obvious this Necessity may appear. 40 \nDE MODO DISPUTANDI \nNOW in this Training of the Child is one most dear Con- \nsideration, that I shall impress upon thee as in Con-\nformity with our holy Experience in the Way of Truth. And it is this, that since that which can be thought is not \ntrue, every Statement is in some sense false. Even \non the Sea of pure Reason, we may say that every State-\nment is in some Sense disputable. Therefore in every Case, \neven the simplest, the Child should be taught not only the \nThesis, but also its opposite, leaving the Decision to the \nchild's own Judgment and good Sense, fortified by Expe-\nrience. And this Practice will develop its Power of \nThought, and its Confidence in itself, and its Interest in \nall Knowledge. But most of all be ware against any At-\ntempt to bias its Mind on any Point that lieth without the \nSquare of ascertained and undisputed Fact. Remember \nalso, even when thou art most sure, that so were they \nsure who gave Instruction to the young Copernicus. Pay \nReverence also to the Unknown unto whom thou presum-\nest to impart thy Knowledge; for he may be one greater \nthan thou. 41 \nDE VOLUNTATE JUVENIS COGNOSCENDA \nIT is important that thou shouldst understand as early \nas may be what is the true Will of the Child in the Mat-\nter of his Career. Be thou well ware of all Ideals and Day-\ndreams; for the Child is himself, and not thy Toy. Recall \nthe comic Tragedy of Napoleon and the King of Rome; \nbuild not an House for a wild Goat, nor plant a Forest for \nthe Domain of a Shark. But be thou vigilant for every \nSign, conscious or unconscious, of the Will of the Child, \ngiving him then all Opportunity to pursue the Path which \nhe thus indicates. Learn this, that he, being young, will \nweary quickly of all false Ways, however pleasant they \nmay be to him at the Outset; but of the true Way he will \nnot weary. This being in this Manner discovered, thou \nmayst prepare it for him perfectly; for no man can keep \nall Roads open for ever. And to him making his Choice, \nexplain how one may not travel far on any one Road \nwithout a general Knowledge of Things apparently irrel-\nevant. And with that he will understand, and bend him \nwisely to his Work. 42 \nDE AURO RUBE\u00b0 \nIWOULD have thee to consider, o my Son, that Word of \nPublius Vergilius Maro, that was the greatest of all the \nMagicians of his Time: in medio tutissimus ibis. Which \nThing hath also been said by many wise Men in other \nLands; and the holy Qabalah confirmeth the same, plac-\ning Tiphereth, which is the Man, and the Beauty and Har-\nmony of Things, and Gold in the Kingdom of the Metals, \nand the Sun among the Planets, in the Midst of the Tree of \nLife For the Centre is the Point of Balance of all Vectors. So then if thouwilt live wisely, learn that thou must esta-\nblish this Relation of Balance with every Thing scever, \nnot omitting one. For there is nothing so alien from thy \nNature that it may not be brought into harmonious Re-\nlation therewith; and thy Stature of Manhood waxeth \ngreat even as thou comest to the Perfection of this Art. And there is nothing so close Kin to thee that it may not \nbe hurtful to thee if this Balance be not truly adjusted. Thou hast need of the whole Force of the Universe to \nwork with thy Will; but this Force must be disposed \nabout the Shaft of that Will so that there is no tendency \nto Hindrance or to Deflection. And in my Love of thee I \nwill adorn this Thesis with Example following. 43 \nDE SAPIENTIA IN RE SEXUALI \nCONSIDER Love. Here is a Force destructive and cor- \nrupting whereby have many Men been lost: witness \nall History. Yet without Love Man were not Man. There-\nfore thine Uncle Richard Wagner made of our Doctrine a \nMusical Fable, wherein we see Amfortas, who yielded \nhimself to Seduction, wounded beyond Healing; Klingsor, \nwho withdrew himself from a like Danger, cast out for \never from the Mountain of Salvation; and Parsifal, who \nyielded not, able to exercise the true Power of Love, and \nthereby to perform the Miracle of Redemption. Of this \nalso have I myself written in my Poema called Adonis. It \nis the same with Food and Drink, with Exercise, with \nLearning itself; the Problem is ever to bring the Appetite \ninto the right Relation with the Will. Thus thou mayst \nfast or feast; there is no Rule, but that of Balance, And \nthis Doctrine is of general Acceptation among the better \nsort of Men; therefore on thee will I rather impress more \ncarefully the other Part of my Wisdom, namely, the \nNecessity of extending constantly thy Nature to new \nMates upon every plane of Being, so that thou mayst \nbecome the perfect Microcosm, an Image without Flaw \nof all that is. 44 \nDE GRADIBUS AEQUIS SCIENTIAE \nI SAY in Sooth, o my Son, that this Extension of thy \nNature is not in Violation thereof; for it is the Nature \nof thy Nature to grow continually. Now there is no part of \nKnowledge which is foreign to thee; yet Knowledge itself \nis of no avail unless it be assimilated and co-ordinated into \nUnderstanding. Grow therefore easily and spontaneously, \ndeveloping all Parts equally, lest thou become a Monster. And if one Thing tempt thee overmuch, correct it by \nDevotion to its Opposite until Equilibrium be re-establish-\ned. But seek not to grow by sudden Determination toward \nThings that be far from thee; only, if such a Thing come \ninto thy Thought, construct a Bridge thereunto, and take \nfirmly the first Step upon that Bridge I shall explain \nthis. Dost thou speculate upon the Motives of the Stars, \nand on their Elements, their Size and Weight? Then \nthou must first gain Knowledge of Things mathematical, \nof Laws physical and chemical. So then first, that thou \nmayst understand clearly the Nature of thine whole Work, \nmap out thy Mind, and extend its Powers from the \nessential outwards, from the near to the far, always with \nFirmness and great Thoroughness, making every Link in \nthy Chain equal and perfect. 45 \nDE VIRTUTE AUDENDI \nVET this I charge thee with my Might: Live Dangerous- \nly. Was not this the Word of thine Uncle Friedrich \nNietzsche? Thy meanest Foe is the Inertia of the Mind. Men do hate most those Things which touch them closely, \nand they fear Light, and persecute the Torchbearers. Do \nthou therefore analyse most fully all those Ideas which \nMen avoid; for the Truth shall dissolve Fear. Rightly in-\ndeed Men say that the Unknown is terrible; but wrongly \ndo they fear lest it become the Known. Moreover, do thou \nall Acts of which the Common Sort beware, save where \nthou hast already full Knowledge, that thou mayst learn \nUse and Control, not falling into Abuse and Slavery. For \nthe Coward and the Foolhardy shall not live out their \nDays. Every Thing bath his right Use; and thou art \ngreat as thou hast Use of Things. This is the Mystery \nof all Art Magick, and thine Hold upon the Universe. Yet \nif thou must err, being human, err by excess of Courage \nrather than of Caution; for it is the Foundation of the \nHonour of Man that he dareth greatly. What saith Quintus \nHoratius Flaccus in the third Ode of his First Book? Die \nthou standing! 46 \nDE ARTE MENTIS COLENDI a) Mathematica \nN\u00b0W concerning the first Foundation of thy Mind I will \nsay somewhat. Thou shalt study with Diligence in the \nMathematics, because thereby shall be revealed unto \nthee the Laws of thine own Reason and the Limitatiiins \nthereof. This Science manifesteth unto thee thy true \nNature in respect of the Machinery whereby it worketh, \nand showeth in pure Nakedness, without Clothing of \nPersonality or Desire the Anatomy of thy conscious Self. Furthermore, by this thou mayst understand the Essence \nof the Relations between all Things, and the Nature of \nNecessity, and come to the Knowledge of Form. For this \nMathematics is as it were the last Veil before the Image \nof Truth, so that there is no Way better than our Holy \nQabalah, which analyseth all Things soever, and reduceth \nthem to pure Number; and thus their Natures being no \nlonger coloured and confused, they may be regulated \nand formulated in Simplicity by the Operation a Pure \nReason, to thy great Comfort in the Work of our Tran-\nscendental Art, whereby the Many become One. 47 \nSEQUITUR b) Classics \nMY son, neglect not in any wise the study of the Writings \nof Antiquity, and that in the original Language. For \nby this thou shalt discover the History of the Structure of \nthy Mind, that is, its Nature regarded as the last Term \nin a Sequence of Causes and Effects. For thy Mind hath \nbeen built up of these Elements, so that in these Books \nthou mayst bring into the Light thine own subconscious \nMemories. And thy Memory is as it were the Mortar in \nthe House of thy Mind, without which is no Cohesion or \nIndividuality possible, so that it is called Dementia. And \nthese Books have lived long and become famous because \nthey are the Fruits of ancient Trees whereof thou art \ndirectly the Heir, wherefore (say I) they are more truly \ngerman to thine own Nature than Books of Collateral \nOffshoots, though such were in themselves better and \nwiser. Yea, o my son, in these Writings thou mayst study \nto come to the true Comprehension of thine own Nature, \nand that of the whole Universe, in the dimension of Time, \neven as the Mathematic declareth it in that of Space: \nthat is, of Extension. Moreover, by this Study shall the \nChild comprehend the Foundation of Manners: the which, \nas sayeth one of the Sons of Wisdom, maketh Man. 48 \nSEQUITUR c) Scientifica \nSINCE Time and Space are the conditions of Mind, these \ntwo Studies are fundamental. Yet there remaineth \nCausality, which is the Root of the Actions and Reactions \nof Nature. This also shalt thou seek ardently, that thou \nmayest comprehend the Variety of the Universe, its Har-\nmony and its Beauty, with the Knowledge of that which \ncompelleth it. Yet this is not equal to the former two in \nPower to reveal thee to thyself; and its first Use is to \ninstruct thee in the true Method of Advancement in \nKnowledge, which is, fundamentally, the Observation of \nthe Like and the Unlike. Also, it shall arouse in thee the \nEcstasy of Wonder ; and it shall bring thee to a proper \nUnderstanding of Art Magick. For cur Magick is but one \nof the Powers that lie within us undeveloped and unana-\nlysed; and it is by the Method of Science that it must be \nmade clear, and available to the Use of Man. Is not this \na Gift beyond Price, the Fruit of a Tree not only of \nKnowledge but of Life? For there is that in Man which is \nGod, and there is that also which is Dust; and by our \nMagick we shall make these twain one Flesh, to the Ob-\ntaining of the Empery of the Universe. 49 \nDE MODO QUO OPERET LEX MAGICA \nGIVE ear attentively, o my Son, while I expound unto \nthee the true Doctrine of Magick. Every Force acteth, \nin due Proportion, on all Things with which it is connected. Thus a burning Forest causeth chemical Change by Com-\nbustion and giveth Heat and Motion to the Air about it by \nthe Operation of physical Laws, and exciteth Thought and \nEmotion in the Man whom it reacheth through his Organs \nof Perception. Consider (even though it were but Legend) \nthe Fall of the Apple of Isaac Newton, its Effect upon the \nSpiritual Destinies of Man ! Consider also that no Force \ncometh ever to the End of its Work; the Air that is moved \nby my Breath is a Disturbance or Change of Equilibrium \nthat cannot be fully compensated and brought to naught, \nthough the Aeons be endless. Who then shall deny the \nPossibility of Magick? Well said Frazer, the most learned \nDoctor of the College of the Holy Trinity in the University \nof Cambridge, that Science was but the Name of Magick \nwhich failed not of its intended Effect. "

    "title": "50 \nDE MACHINA MAGICA \nLO!",
    "content": "I put forth my Will, and my Pen moveth upon the \nPaper, by cause that my Will mysteriously hath Power \nupon the Muscles of my Arm, and these do work at a \nmechanical Advantage against the Inertia of the Pen. I cannot break down the Wall opposite me, by cause that \nI cannot come into mechanical Relation with it; or the Wall \nat my side, by cause that I am not strong enough to over-\ncome its Inertia. To win that Battle I must call Time and \nPick-axe to mine Aid. But how could I retard the Motion \nof the Earth in Space? I am myself Party of its Momentum. Yet every stroke of my Pen affecteth that Motion \nby changing the Equilibrium thereof. The Problem of eve-\nry Act of Magick is then this: to exert a Will, sufficiently \npowerful to cause the required Effect,through a Menstruum \nor Medium of Communication. By the common Under-\nstanding of the word Magick, we yet exclude such Media \nas are generally known and understood. Now then, o my \nSon, will I declare unto thee first the Nature of the Power, \nand afterward that of the Medium. 51 \nDE HARMONIA ANIMAE CUM CORPORE \nALL Things are interwoven. The most spiritual Thought \nin thy Soul (I speak as a Fool) is also a most material \nChange in Blood or Brain. Anger maketh the blood acid; \nHate poisoneth Mother's Milk; even as I shewed formerly \nin reverse, how Disturbance of physical Function altereth \nthe states of Consciousness. Now no Man doubteth the\u2022 \nPower of the Will of Man, whether it be his Love that \nbegetteth Children or causeth Wars wherein many Men \nbe slain, whether it be his Eloquence that moveth a Mob, \nor his Vanity that destroyeth a People. Only in all such \nCases we understand how Nature worketh, through known \nLaws physical or psychical. That is, there is a State of \nunstable Equilibrium, so that one Machine setteth another \nin Motion as soon as the first Disturbance ariseth. There-\nfore, it is not proper to regard all Consequence of a Will \nas its Effect. Without the Revolution there could have been \nno great Effect of the Will of Napoleon; and moreover \nhis Will was broken in the End, to the present Misfortune \n(as it seemeth to many besides myself) of Mankind. This \nMagick, therefore, dependeth greatly on the Art to set \nmany other Wills in sympathetic Motion; and the greatest \nMagus may not be the most successful\u2014 in a mean Con-\nception of a Limit of Time. He may need many Blows \nbefore he breaketh down his Wall, if that be strong, \nwhile a Child may push over one that is ready to crumble. 52 \nDE MYSTERIO PRUDENTIAE \nBEHOLD now Nature, how prodigal is She of her Forces! The evident Will of every Acorn is to become an Oak; \nyet nigh all fail of that Will. Therefore one Secret of Magick \nis CEconomy of thy Force; to do no Act unless secure of \nits Effect. And if every Act hath an Effect on every Plane, \nhow canst thou do this unless thou be connected with \nall Planes? For this reason must thou know thoroughly \nnot only thy Body and thy Mind, but thy Body of Light \nand all its subtler Principles soever. But I will have thee \nto consider most especially what Powers thou hast within \nthee which are certainly capable of great Effects, yet which \nare constantly wasted. Think then whether if these \nPowers, frustrate of their End upon one Plane, might not \nbe turned to high Purpose and assured Success upon \nanother. For an hundred Acorns, rightly set in Condi-\ntions fit for their true Growth, will become an hundred \nOaks, while otherwise they make but one Meal for one \nHog, and their subtile Nature is wholly lost to them. Learn \nthen, o my Son, this mystery of (Economy and apply it \nfaithfully and with Diligence in thy Work. 53 \nDE ARTE ALCHEMICA \nHERE then must I write concerning Talismans for thine \nInstruction. Know first that there are certain Vehicles \nproper for the Incarnation of the Will. I instance Paper, \nwhereon by thine Art thou writest a symbolic Representa-\ntion of thy Will, so that when thou next seest it, thou art \nreminded of that Will, or it may be that another, seeing it, \nis moved to obey that Will. Here then is a case of Incarna-\ntion and Assumption, which, before it was understood, was \nrightly considered Gramarye or Magick. Again, thy Will \nto live causeth thee to plant Corn, which in due Season be-\ning eaten is again transmuted into Will. Thus thou mayst \nin many Ways impress any particular Will upon the prop-\ner Substance, so that by due Use thou comest at last to its \nAccomplishment. So general is this Formula, in Truth, that \nall conscious Actions may be included within its Scope. There is also the converse, as when external Objects create \nAppetite, whose Satisfaction again reacteth upon the \nphysical Plane. Praise thou the Wonder of the Mystery of \nNature, rising and falling with every Breath, so that there \nis no Part which is not mystically Partaker of the Whole. 54 \nDE ARCANO SUBTILISSIMO \n0 MY son, there is that within thee of marvellous Puis- \nsance which is by its own Nature the Incarnation of thy \nWill, most ready to receive the Seal thereof. Therein \nlie hidden all Powers, all Memories, more than thou hast \nthyself ten thousandfold! Learn then to draw from that \ngreat Treasure-House the Jewel of which thou art in any \npresent Need. For all Things that are possible to thy \nNature are already hidden within thee; and thou hast but \nto name them, and to bring them back into the Light of \nthy Consciousness. Then squander not this Gold of thine, \nbut put it to most fruitful Usury. Now then of the Art and \nCraft of this most holy Mystery I write not, for a Reason \nthat thou already knowest. Moreover, in this Matter thou \nshalt best learn by thine own Experience, and thine Obser-\nvation in true Science shall guide thee. For this Secret is \nstill of Magick, and occult, so that I know not certainly if \nthy Will lieth my Way or no. 55 \nDE MENSTRUO ARTIS \nBUT concerning the Medium by whose sensitive Nature \nour Magick Force is transmitted to the Object of our \nWorking, doubt not. For already in other Galaxies of \nPhysics have some been compelled to postulate an Athyr \nwholly hypothetical in order to explain the Phenomena of \nLight, Electricity, and the like; nor doth any man demand \nDemonstration of the Existence of that 2Ethyr other than \nits Conformity with general Law. Thou therefore Creator \nand Transmittor of thine own Energy, needest not to ask \nwhether by this or by some other Means thou performest \nthy Work. Yet I know not why this Athyr which the \nMathematicians al I the Physicists imagined, yet were \nnot able to \u2022efine, its Nature being beyond Reason, should \nnot be one with the Astral Light, or Plastic Medium, or \nAub, Aud, Aur (these three being a Trinity) of which our \nown Sages have spoken. And this Meditation may bring \nforth much Knowledge physical, which is good, for that \nwhich is above is Ake that which is beneath, and the Study \nof any Law leadeth to the understanding of all Law. So \nmayst thou learn in the End that there is no Law beyond \nDo what thou wilt. 56 \nDE NECESSITATE VOLUNTATIS \nAND how then (sayst thou?) shall I reconcile this Art \nMagick with that Way of the Tao which achieveth all \nThings by doing Nothing? But this have I already declared \nto thee in Part, shewing that thou canst do no Magick save \nit be thy Nature to do Magick, and so the true Nothing \nfor thee. For to do Nothing signifieth to interfere with \nNothing, so that for a Magician to do no Magick is to com-\nmit Violence on himself. Yet learn also that all Action \nis in some sense Magick, being an essential part of that \nGreat Magical Work which we call Nature. Then thou \nhast no Free Will? Verily, thou hast said. Yet never the \nless it is thy necessary Destiny to act with that Free Will. Thou canst do nothing save in accordance with that Nature \nof thine and of all Things, and every Phenomenon is the \nResultant of the Totality of Forces: Amen. Then thou \nneedst take no Thought and make no Effort? Thou sayest \nsooth; yet, art thou not compelled to Thought and Effort \nin the Way of Nature? Yea, I, thy Father, work for thee \nsolicitously, and also I laugh at thy Perplexities; for so was \nit foreordained that I should do, by Me, from the Begin-\nning. 57 \nDE COMOEDIA UNIVERSA, QUAE DICITUR BAN \ntherefore, o my Son, count thyself happy when thou \nunderstandest all these Things, being one of those \nBeings (or By-comings) whom we call Philosophers. All is \na never-ending Play of Love wherein Our Lady Nuit and \nHer Lord Hadit rejoice; and every Part of the Play is Play \nAll Pain is but sharp Sauce to the Dish of Pleasure; for it \nis the Nature of the Universe that hath devised this ever-\nlasting Banquet of Joy. And he that knoweth not this is \nnecessary as an Ingredient even as thou art; wouldst thou \nchange all, and spoil the Dish? Art thou the Master-Cook? Yea, for thy Palate is become fine with thy great \nDalliance with the Food of Experience; therefore thou \nart one of them that rejoice. Also it is thy Nature as it is \nmine, o my Son, to will that all men share our Mirth and \nJollity; wherefore have I proclaimed my Law to Man, \nand thou continuest in that Work of Joyaunce. 58 \nDE CAECITIA HOMINUM \nLEARN also of my Wisdom that this Vision of the Cosmos \nwhereof I have here written unto thee is not given unto \nthy Sight at all Times; for in that Vision is all Will ful-\nfilled. Thou seest the Universe as Non; and as One, \nand as Many, and thou seest the Play thereof and there-\nwith art thou (who art no longer thou) content. For in one \nPhase art thou also None, in another One, and in the third \nan organized and necessary Part of that great Structure, \nso that there is no more Conflict at all in thy whole By-\ncoming. But now will I make Light for thine Eyes in this \nMatter as thou gropest, asking: but of them that see not \nthis, what sayest thou, o my Father? But in that Vision \nthou sayest not thus, my Son! Learn then of me the Secret \nMystery of Illusion, and how it worketh, and of the Holy \nLaw that is its Nature, and of thine Action therein; for \nthis is an Arcanum of the Wisdom of the Magi, and proper \nunto thee that dwellest in the Land of Understanding. 59 \nALLEGORIA DE CAISSA \nCONSIDER for an example the Game and Play of the \nChess, which is a Pastime of Man, and worthy to exer-\ncise him in Thought, yet by no means necessary to his Life, \nso that he sweepeth away Board and Pieces at the least \nSummons of that which is truly dear to him. Thus unto \nhim this Game is as it were an Illusion. But insofar as he \nentereth into the Game he abideth by the Rules thereof, \nthough they be of Artifice and in no wise proper to his \nNature; for in this Restriction is all his Pleasure. There-\nfore, though he hath All-Power to move the Pieces at his \nown Will, he doth it not, enduring Loss, Indignity, and \nDefeat rather than destroy that Artifice of Illusion. Think \nthen that thou hast thyself created this Shadowworld the \nUniverse, and that it pleasureth thee to watch or to \nactuate its Play according to the Law that thou hast made, \nwhich yet bindeth thee not save only by Virtue of thine \nown Will to thine own Pleasure therein. 60 \nDE VERITATE FALSI \nMOREOVER this Matter toucheth the Nature of Truth. For although to thee in thy True Self, absolute and \nwithout conditions, all this Universe, which is relative and \nconditioned, is an Illusion; yet to that Part of thee by \nwhich thou perceivest it, the Law of its Being (or By-com-\ning) is a Law of Truth. Learn then that all Relations are \ntrue upon their own Plane, and that it would be a Viola, \ntion of Nature to adjust them skew-wise. Thus, albeit thou \nhast found Thy Self, and knowest Thy Self immortal and \nimmutable, beyond Time and Space, free of Causality, so \nthroughly that even thy Mind partaketh constantly there-\nof, thou hast in no wise altered the Relations of thy Body \nwith its Syndromies in the World whereof it is a Part. Wouldst thou lengthen the Life of thy Body? Then accom-\nmodate thou the Conditions of thy Body to its Environ-\nment by giving it Light, Air, Food, and Exercise as its Na-\nture requireth. So also, mutatis mutandis, do thou cherish \nthe Health of thy Mind. 61 \nDE RELATIONE ILLUSIONUM \nOF this will I speak further with thee, for here behold a \ngreat Rock of Ignorance on the one Hand, and on the \nother a Whirlpool of Error; in this Strait are many Wrecks \nof Magick Ships. Knowest thou not that Riddle of old, \nwhether it be lawful to pay Tribute to Cwsar or no? Give \ntherefore to the Body the things of the Body, and to the \nMind the things of the Mind. Yet because of the Interior \nHarmony of all Things that proceedeth from their Original \nOne Nature, there is Action and Reaction of the one upon \nthe other, as I have already set forth in this mine Epistle. But Law is universal, and between these two Kinds of \nIllusion there is an ordered Proportion, and it is proper to \nthy Science to delimit and describe this Law of Interac-\ntion ; for to deny it wholly (as to extend it to Infinity) is \nFolly, born of Ignorance, Idleness, and Incapacity to ob-\nserve Fact. 62 \nDE PRUDENTIA \nCONSIDER Drunkenness, how by Variation of bodily \nConditions thou mayst alter its Effect upon the Mind, \nand the contrary, remembering the Discipline of Theo-\nphrastus Paracelsus, how, opposing Wine to bodily Exer-\ncise, he obtained a certain Purification and Exaltation. Yet, were he seven times greater, he had not done this \nwith Oil of Vitriol. Learn then that there are certain \ndefinite Channels of Action and Reaction beween Body \nand Mind; sound these, and trim thy Sails accordingly, \nnot thinking that thou art in the open Sea. And if so be \nthat thou in thy Sounding findest new Channels, rejoice, \nand map them for the Profit of thy Fellows; but remem-\nber constantly that to find one new Way up a Precipice \nremoveth not the Precipice. For where thou, o Angel and \nyet Maxi, hast trod delicately albeit without Fear Fools \nwill rush in to their Destruction. 63 \nDE RATIONE MAGI VITAE \nSTUDY thou Logic, which is the Code of the Laws of \nThought. Study the Method of Science, which is the \nApplication of Logic to the Facts of the Universe. Think \nnot that thou canst ever abrogate these Laws, for though \nthey be Limitations, they are the Rules of thy Game which \nthou dost play. For in thy Trances though thou becomest \nThat which is not subject to those Laws, they are still final \nin respect of those Things which thou hast set them to \ngovern. Nay, o my Son, this Word govern, liketh me not, \nfor a Law is but a Statement of the Nature of the Thing \nto which it applieth. For nothing is compelled save only \nby Virtue of its own true Will. So therefore human Law \nis a Statement of the Will and of the Nature of Man, or else \nit is a Falsity contrary thereunto, and becometh null and \nof none Effect. 64 \nDE CORDE CANDID\u00b0 \nTHINK also, o my Son, of this Image, that if two States \nbe at Peace, a Man goeth between them without let; but \nif there be War, all Gateways are forthwith closed, save \nonly for a few, and these are watched and guarded, so \nthat the Obstacles are many. This then is the case of \nMagick; for if thou have brought to Harmony all Principles \nwithin thee, thou mayst work easily to transmute a Force \n, into its semblable upon another Plane, which is the essen-\ntial Opus of our Art; but if thou be at War within thyself, \nhow canst thou work? For our Master Hermes Trisme-\ngistus hath written at the Head of his Tablet of Emerald \nthis Word: That which is above is like that which is below, \nand that which is below is like that which is above, \nfor the Performance of the Miracles of the One Substance. How then, if these be not alike? If the Substance of Thee \nbe Two, and not One? And herein is the Need of the \nConfession of a Pure Heart, as it is written in the Papyrus \nof the Dead. 65 \nDE CONFORMITATE MAGI \nSEE to it therefore, o my Son, that thou in thy Working \ndost no Violence to the Whole Will of the AIL or to the \nWill common to all those Beings (or By-comings) that are \nof one general Nature with thee, or to thine own particular \nWill. For first of all thou art necessarily moved toward \nthe One End from thine own Station, but secondly thou \nart moved toward the End proper to thine own Race, and \nCaste, and Family, as by Virtue of thy Birth. And these \nare, I may say it, Conditions or Limits of thine own indi-\nvidual Will. Thou dost laugh? What, sayest thou, of the \nRevolutionary Will? Err not, my Son! The Magus, even \nas the Poet, is the Expression of the True Will of his \nFellows; and his Success is his Proof, as it is written \nin the Book of the Law. For his Work is to free Men from \nthe Fetters of a false or superannuated Will, revealing \nto them, in Measure attuned to their present Needs, their \ntrue Natures. 66 \nDE POETIS \nFOR this Reason is the Poet called an Incarnation of the \nZeitgeist, that is, of the Spirit or Will of his Period. So \nevery Poet is also a Prophet, because when that which he \nsayeth is recognized as the Nxpression of their own \nThought by Men, they translate this into Act, so that, in \nthe Parlance of Folk vulgar and ignorant, \"that which he \nforetold is come to pass.\" Now then the Poet is Interpreter \nof the Hieroglyphs of the Hidden Will of Man in many a \nMatter, some light, some deep, as it may be given unto \nhim to do. Moreover, it is not altogether in the Word of \nany Poem, but in the quintessential Flavour of the Poet, \nthat thou mayst seek this Prophecy. And this is an Art \nmost necessary to every Statesman. Who but Shelley fore-\ntold the fel/ of Christianity, and the Organization of La-\nbour, and the Freedom of Woman; who but Nietzsche \ndeclared the Principle at the Root of the World-War? See \nthou clearly then that in these Men were the Keys of the \ndark Gates of the Future; should not the Kings and their \nMinisters have taken heed thereto, fulfilling their Word \nwithout Conflict?

    "content": "\u2022 . QUIBUS CARO \nFIT VERBUM \nI \\TOW, o my Son, the Incarnation of a Poet, is particular \nand not Universal; he sayeth indeed true Things, but \nnot the Things of All-Truth. And that these may be said \nit is necessary that One take human Flesh, and become a \nMagus in our Holy Order. He then is called the Logos, \nor Logos Aionos, that is to say, the Word of the Aeon or \nAge, because He is verily That Word. And thus may He \nbe known, because He hath it given unto Him to prepare \nthe Quintessence of the Will of God, that is, of Man, in \nits Fullness and Wholeness, comprehending all Planes; \nso that His Law is simple, and radical, penetrating all \nSpace from its single Light. For though His Words be \nmany, yet is His Word One, One and Alone; and by this \nWord he createth Man anew, in an Essential Form of Life, \nso that he is changed in his inmost Knowledge of himself. And this Change worketh outwards, little by little, unto \nits visible Effects. 68 \nDE MAGIS TEMPORIS ANTIQUI; IMPRIMIS, \nDE LAO-TZE \nIT may be unto thy Profit, o my Son, ill relate unto thee \nthe secret History of those who have gone before me in \nthis Grade of Magus, so far as Their Memory hath remain-\ned among Mankind. For what would it avail thee should I \nrecount the deeds of Those whom I indeed may know, \nbut thou not? Thou knowest well how I keep me from \nall Taint of Fable, or of any Word unproven or unclemon-\nstrable. First then I speak of Lao-tze, whose Word was \nTAO. Hereof have I already written much unto thee, be-\ncause His Doctrine hath been lost or misinterpreted, and \nit is most needful to restore it. For this Tao is the true \nNature of Things, being itself a Way or Going, that is, a \nkinetic and not a static Conception. Also He taught this \nWay of Harmony in Will, which I myself have sought to \nshew thee in this Epistle. So then this Tao is Truth, and \nthe Way of Truth, and therefore was Lao-Tze Logos of His \nAeon, and His true Word or Name was TAO. 69 \nDE GAUT AMA \nWHOM men call Gautama, or Siddartha, or The Buddha, \nwas a Magus of Our Holy Order. And His Word was \nANATTA; for the Root of His whole Doctrine was that \nthere is no Atman, or Soul, as Men ill translate it, meaning \na Substance incapable of Change. Thus He, like Lao-tze, \nbased all upon a Movement, instead of a fixed Point. And \nHis Way of Truth was Analysis, made possible by great \nIntention of the Mind towards itself, and that well fortified \nby a certain tempered Rigour of Life. And He most thor-\noughly explored and mapped out the Fastnesses of the \nMind, and gave the Keys of its Fortresses into the Hands \nof Man. But of all this the Quintessence is in this one \nWord ANATTA, because this is not only the Foundation \nand the Result of His whole Doctrine, but the Way of its \nWork. 70 \nDE SRI KRISHNA, ET DE DIONYSO \nKRISHNA hath names and forms innumerable, and I \nknow not his true human Birth. For his Formula is of \nthe major Antiquity. But His Word hath spread into many \nlands, and we know it to-day as INRI with the secret IAO \nconcealed therein. And the meaning of this Word is the \nWay of the Working of Nature in Her Changes; that is, it is \nthe Formula of Magick whereby all Things reproduce and \nrecreate themselves. Yet this Extension and Specialization \nwas rather the Word of Dionysus; for the true Word ot \nKrishna was AUM, importing rather a statement of the \nTruth of Nature than a practical Instruction in detailed \nOperations of Magick. But Dionysus, by the Word INRI, \nlaid the Foundations of all Science, as we say Science \nto-day in a particular Sense, that is, of causing external \nNature to change in Harmony with our Wills. 71 \nDE TAHUTI \nTAHUTI, or Thoth, confirmed the Word of Dionysus by \ncontinuing it; for He shewed how by the Mind it was \npossible to direct the Operations of the Will. By Criticism \nand by recorded Memory Man avoideth Error, and the \nRepetition of Error. But the true Word of Tahuti was \nAMOUN, whereby He made Men to understand their \nsecret Nature, that is, their Unity with their True Selves, \nor, as they then phrased it, with God. And he discovered \nunto them the Way of this Attainment, and its relation \nwith the Formula of INTO. Also by his Mystery of Number \nhe made plain the Path for His Successor to declare the \nNature of the whole Universe in its Form and in its Struc-\nture, as it were an Analysis thereof, doing for Matter what \nthe Buddha was decreed to do for Mind. 72 \nDE QUODAM MACK) AEGYPTIORUM, QUEM \nAPPELUNT JUDAEI MOSHEH \nTHE Follower of Tahuti was an Egyptian whose name is \nlost; but the Jews called Him Mosheh, or Moses, and \ntheir Fabulists made Him the Leader of their legendary \nExodus. Yet they preserved His Word, and it is IFIVH, \nwhich thou must understand also as that secret Word \nwhich thou hast seen and heard in Thunders and Light-\nnings in thine Initiation to the Degree thou wottest of. But this Word is itself a Plan of the Fabrick of the Uni-\nverse, and upon it hath been elaborated the Holy Qabalah, \nwhereby we have Knowledge of the Natures of all Things \nsoever upon every plane of By-coming, and of their Forces \nand Tendencies and Operations, with the Keys to their \nPortals. Nor did He leave any Part of His Work unfinished, \nunless it be that accomplished three hundred Years ago \nby Sir Edward Kelly, of whom also I come, as thou know-\nest. "

    "content": "in these chapters have I thy Father restricted \nmyself, not speaking of any immediate Echo of a Word \nin the World, because, these men being long since with-\ndrawn into Their Silence, it is Their One Word, and that \nAlone, that resoundeth undiminished through Time. Now \nMohammed, who followeth, is darkened and confused by \nhis nearness to our own Time, so that I say not save with \nDiffidence that His Word ALLH may mean this or that. But Tam bold concerning His Doctrine of the Unity of God, \nfor God is Man, and He said therefore: Man is One. And \nHis Will was to unite all men in One Reasonable Faith: \nto make possible Co-operation of all Races in Science. Yet, because he arose in the time of the greatest possible \nCorruption and Darkness, when every Civilization and \nevery Religion had fallen into Ruin, by the Malice of the \ngreat Sorcerer of Nazareth, as some say, He is still hidden \nin the Dust of the Simoom, and we may not perceive Him \nin His true Self of Glory. Nevertheless, behold, o my Son, this Mystery. His true \nWord was LA ALLH that is to say: (There is) No God, and \nLA AL is that Mystery of Mysteries which thine own Eye \npierced in thine Initiation. And of that Truth have the \nIllusion and Falsehood enslaved the Souls of Men, as \nit is written in the Book of the Magus. 74 \nDE SE IPSO \nTRI MEVAAM 0EPH21, TM A01121 AIUNOE, \nCUJTJS VERBUM EST \n13Anpa \n11 MY Son! me seemeth in certain Hours that I am myself \nfallen on a Time even more fearful and fatal than did \nMohammed, peace be upon Him! But I read clearly the \nWord of the Aeon, that is ABRAHADABRA wherein is the \nwhole Mystery of the Great Work, as thou knowest. And \nI have the Book of the Law, that was given unto me by \nHim thou wottest of; and it is the Interpretation of the \nSecret Will of Man on every plane of his By-coming; and \nthe Word of the Law is THELEMA, Do what thou wilt \nshall be the whole of the Law. Now because Love is the \nlaw, love under will, do I write this Epistle for thee, that \nthou mayst fulfil this inmost Will of Mankind making them \ncapable of Light, Life, Love and Liberty by the Accept-\nance of this Law. And the Hindrance thereunto is but as \nthe Shell of its Egg to an Eaglet, a Thing foreign to itself, \na Protection until the Hour strike, and then an End \nthereof. 75 \nMANDATUM AD FILITJM SUUM \nHERE I reach forth mine Hands against thee in the Sign \nof the Enterer, o Son of my Bowels, for with all my \nmagical Might I will that thou fight manfully and labour \nwith Diligence (with Sword and Trowel, say I) in this \nWork. For this is the first and last of all, that thou bid \nevery Man do what he will, in Accord with his own true \nNature. Therefore also blast thou that Lie that Man is of a \nfallen and evil Nature. For the Word of Sin is Restriction, \nthe Doubt of his own Godhead, the Suppression of, which \nis the Blasphemy against, his own Holy Spirit. Saith not \nthe Book of the Law that \"It is a lie, this folly against \nself\"? Therefore to every Man, in every Circumstance, \nsay thou: Do what thou wilt; and teach him, if he yet \nwaver, how to discover his true Nature, earnestly and \nwith Ardour, even as I have striven to teach thee\u2014yea, \nand more also! 76 \nQUARE FILIUM CREAVIT: TIT FIAT LIBERTAS \nDO what thou wilt !\u2014be this our Slogan of Battle in \nevery Act; for every Act is Conflict. There Victory \nleapeth shining before us; for who may thwart True Will, \nwhich is the Order of Nature Herself? Thou hast no Right \nbut to do thy Will; Do that, and no other shall say nay. For \nif that Will be true, its Fulfilment is of a Surety as Day-\nlight following Sunrise. It is certain as the Operation of \nany other Law of Nature; it is Destiny. Then, if that Will \nbe obscured, if thou turn from it to Wills diseased or per-\nverse, how canst thou hope? Fool! Even thy Turns and \nTwists are in the Path to thine appointed End. But thou \nart not sprung of a Slave's Loins; thou standest firm and \nstraight; thou dost thy Will; and thou art chosen, nay, for \nthis Work wast thou begotten in a Magick Bed, that thou \nshouldst make Men free. 77 \nDE STJA DEBILITATE \nLISTEN attentively, my Son, while I with heavy Heart \nmake Confession to thee of mine own Frailty. Thou \nknowest that I made Renunciation of my Wage, taking this \nBody immediately after my Death, the Death of Eli-\nphaz Levi Zahed, as Men say, that I might attain to this \nGreat Work. It is now twenty Years, as Men count years, \nthat I came to my first Understanding of my true Nature, \nand aspired to that Work. Now then at the first I made no \nError. I abandoned my chosen Career; I poured out my \nwhole Fortune without one Thought; I gave my Life up \nutterly to the Work without keeping back the least imag-\ninable Thing. So then I made swift Strides along the Path. But in the Dhyanas that were granted unto me in Kandy, \nin the Island of Lanka, I used up my whole Charge of \nmagical Energy; and for two Years I fell away from the \nWork. 78 \nDE MANU QUAE MAGUM SUSTINET \nNOW it may well be that such Periods of Recuperation \nare Necessary to such weak Souls as mine; and so no \nIll. But I fell from my Will, and sought other Ends in Life; \nand so the Hand came upon me, and tore away that which \nI desired, as thou knowest; also it is written in The Temple \nof Solomon the King. Yet consider also these two Years \nas a necessary Preparation for that greatest of all Events \nwhich befell me in El-Kahira, in the Land of Khem, the \nChoice of me as the Word of the Aeon. Now then for \nawhile I worked with my Will, though not wholly; and \nagain the Hand reached forth and smote me. This, albeit \nmy Slackness was but as a Boy playing Truant, not a \nRevolt against my Self. Wherefore, despite all, I made \nmuch Progress in short Time. 79 \nDE SUO PECCATO \nNOW then, well schooled, I strove no more against my \nNature, and worked with all my Will. Thou knowest \nwell how greatly I was rewarded. Yet in this last Initiation \nto the Grade of Magus, wherein three-and-seventy Days, \nas Men count Days, is but One Day, the Ordeal grew so \nfierce and so intolerable that I gave back a Step. I did not \nutterly renounce the Work, but I swore not to continue \nunless mine Agony were abated. But after fifteen Days, I \ncame to myself in a certain Ordeal, wherein I knew myself \nfinally, that I could not do other than take up that fearful \nBurden that had broken my Spirit. And for those fifteen \nDays have I not suffered infinite Things? Was not the Tree \nof my Work frozen, one Branch withered, and one blasted? Look no more, o my Son, upon thy Father's Shame! 80 \nDE SUA VICTORIA PER NOMEN BABALON \nAND after? This Dawn (for I have toiled through the \nNight in my great Love and Care of thee) how is it \nwith me? It is well. For I have found myself; I have found \nmy Will; the Obstacles that daunted me are seen to be but \nShadows of Shadows. Grace be unto our Lady BABALON. Thus it is written in the Book of the Law: Remember \nall ye that existence is pure joy; that all the sorrows are \nbut as shadows; they pass 8z are done; but there is that \nwhich remains. Learn then that it is in the Contemplation of Division \nthat Sorrow is, for Division is the Formula of Choronzon. It is therefore discreet for thee to unite each Element of \nSorrow with its opposite; in whose Triumph of Hymen is \nEcstasy, until by the Apprehension of the new great Op-\nposite the Idea is again seen as Sorrow. This then is the \nIssue from Sorrow; and thou mayst understand that I now \nalso am confident in the Necessity of this my Fall to pre-\npare the Formula of Mine Exaltation. Therefore, my Son, \nthus hail Me: Blessing and Worship to the Beast, the \nProphet of the Lovely Star. 81 \nDE ARCANO NEFANDO \noMY Son, learn this concerning Magick, that the Yang \nmoveth, and thus giveth itself up Eternally; but the \nYin moveth not, seeking ever to enclose or restrict, repro-\nducing in its own Likeness what Impression soever is made \nthereon, yet without Surrender. Now the Tao absorbeth all \nwithout Reproduction; so then let the Yang turn thereto, \nand not unto the Yin. And that thou mayst understand \nthis, I say: It is a Mystery of O.T.O. For the Sun ariseth \nnot and entereth to strike upon the High Altar of the \nMinster by the Great Western Gates, but by the Rose \nOriel doth he make Way and Progress in His Pageant. Oh \nmy Son ;  the Doors of Silver are wide open, and they tempt \nthee with their Beauty; but by the narrow Portal of Pure \nGold shalt thou come more nobly to the Sanctuary. Be-\nhold! thou knowest not how perfect is this Magick; it is \nthe dearest-bought and holiest of our Arcana. What then \nis like unto my Love toward Thee, that bestoweth upon \nthee this Treasure of my Wisdom? My son, neglect it not; \nfor it is the Exorcism of Exorcisms, and the Enchantment \nof Enchantments. 82 \nDE ARCANO, PER QUOD SPIRITUS QUIDAM \nIN CORPORE RECIPIATUR \nHERE now is another Formula of Power, good to invoke \nany Being to manifest in thyself. First, invoke him by \nthe Power of all thy Spells and Conjurations, with Mind \nconcentrated and Will vehement, toward him, as I have \nwritten in many Books. But because thou art NEMO, thou \nmayst safely invoke him, no matter of what Nature, within \nthy Circle. Now then do thou confer on him as the Guer-\ndon of his Obedience the Dignity of a Soul seeking Incar-\nnation, and so proceed to consecrate thine Act by per-\nforming the Mass of the Holy Ghost. Then shall that \nSpirit make himself Body from those Elements; and thou \npartaking thereof makest thine own Body his Machinery \nof Manifestation. And thus mayst thou work with any \nSpirit soever; yet this shall serve thee most in common \nLife. Also, the Qualities are well defined in the Cards of \nthe Tarot, so that thou hast a clear-cut Means of develop-\ning thy Powers according to the Need of the Time. But \nlearn also this, to work constantly under the Guidance of \nthine Holy Guardian Angel, so that thy Workings be \nalway in Harmony and Accord with thy True Will. 83 \nDE CLAW KABBALISTICA HUJUS ARTIS \nNOW then to thee who art long since Master of High \nMagick, it will be easy to shew how the Mass of the \nHoly Ghost, sung even in Ignorance, may work many a \nWonder by Virtue of the Force generated being compelled \nto manifest on other than its own Plane. Here then is a \nTheory of the Mystery of the Aeon, that I, being the Logos \nappointed thereunto, did create an Image of my Little \nUniverse in the Mind of the Woman of Scarlet; that is, I \nmanifested mine whole Magical Self in her Mind. Thus \nthen in Her, as in a Mirror, have I been able to interpret \nmyself to myself. Thou also in thine own Way hast the \nPower to create such an Image; but be thou sure and alert, \ntesting constantly the Persons in that Image by the Holy \nQabalah and by the True Signs of Brotherhood. For each \nPerson therein shall be a Part of Thy Self, made individ-\nual and perfect, able to instruct thee in thy Path. Yet often \nthere shall be others, that are to aid thee in thy Working, \nor to oppose it. And in this Matter thou shalt read especial-\nly the Record of thy Father his Working with Soror Ahitha \n(blessed be Her Name unto the Ages!) and certain others \nto Boot. 84 \nDE MISSA SPIRITUS SANCTI \nNOW at last, o my Son, may I bring thee to understand \nthe Truth of this Formula that is hidden in the Mass \nof the Holy Ghost. For Horus that is Lord of the Aeon is \nthe Child crowned and conquering. The Formula of Osiris \nwas, as thou knowest, a Word of Death, that is, the Force \nlay long in Darkness, and by Putrefaction came to Resur-\nrection. But we take living Things, and pour in Life and \nSpirit of the Nature of our own Will, so that instantly and \nwithout Corruption the Child (as it were the Word of that \nWill) is generated; and again immediately taketh up his \nHabitation among us to manifest in Force and Fire. This \nMass of the Holy Ghost is then the true Formula of the \nMagick of the Aeon, even of the Aeon of Horus, blessed \nbe He in His Name Ra-Hoor-Khuit! And thou shalt bless \nalso the Name of our Father Merlin, Frater Superior of the \n0.T.O., for that by Seven Years of Apprenticeship in His \nSchool did I discover this most excellent Way of Magick. Be thou diligent, o my Son, for in this wondrous Art is no \nmore Toil, Sorrow, and Disappointment, as it was in the \ndead Aeon of the Slain Gods. 85 \nDE FORMULA TOTA \nHERE then is thy Schedule for all Operations of Magick. First: thou shalt discover thy True Will, as I have \nalready taught thee and that Bud thereof which is the \nPurpose of this Operation. Next, formulate this Bud-Will as a Person, seeking or \nconstructing it, and naming it, according to thine Holy \nQabalah, and its infallible Rule of Truth. Third: purify and consecrate this Person, concentrating \nupon him, and against all else. This Preparation shall \ncontinue in all thy daily Life. Mark well: make ready a \nNew Child immediately after every Birth. Fourth: make an especial and direct Invocation at thy \nMass, before the Introit, formulating a visible Image of \nthis Child, and offering the Right of Incarnation. Fifth: perform the Mass, not omitting the Epiklesis, and \nlet there be a Golden Wedding Ring at the Marriage of thy \nLion with thine Eagle. Sixth: at the Consumption of the Eucharist accept this \nChild, losing thy Consciousness in him, until he be well \nassimilated within thee. Now then do this continuously, for by Repetition cometh \nforth both Strength and Skill, and the Effect is cumulative, \nif thou allow no time for it to dissipate itself. 86 \nDE HAC FORMULA CONSIDERATIONES \nKABBALISTICAE \nBEHOLD moreover, my son, the (Economy of this Way, \nhow it is according to the Tao, fulfilling itself wholly \nwithin thine own Sphere. And it is utterly in Tune with \nthine own Will on every Plane, so that every Part of thy \nNature rejoiceth with every other Part, communicating \nPraise. Now then learn also how this Formula is that of \nthe Word ABRAHADABRA. First, HAD is the Triangle \nerect upon twin Squares. Of Hadit need I not to write, for \nHe hath hidden Himself in the Book of the Law. The \nSubstance is the Father, the Instrument is the Son, and \nthe Metaphysical Ecstasy is the Holy Ghost, whose name \nis HRILIU. These are then the Sun, Mercury and Venus, \nwhose sacred Letters are R, B, and 0. But the last of the \ndiverse Letters is H, which in the Tarot is The Star whose \nEidolon is D; and herein is that Arcanum concerning the \nTao of which I have already written. Of this will I not \nwrite more plainly. But mark this, that our Trinity is our \nPath Inwards in the Solar System, and that H being of \nOur Lady NUIT Starry, is an Anchor to this Magick \nwhich else were apt to deny our Wholeness of Relation \nto the Outer as to the Inner. My Son, ponder these Words, \nand profit by them; for I have wrought cunningly to \nconceal or to reveal, according to thine Intelligence, o my \nSon! 87 \nDE QUIBUSDAM ARTIST'S MAGICIS \nNOW of those Operations of Magick by which thou seek- \nest to display unto some other Person the Righteous-\nness of thy Will I make haste to instruct thee. First, if \nthou have a reasonable Link with him by Word or Letter, \nit is most natural simply to create in thyself, as I have \ntaught, a Child or Bud-Will, and let that radiate from thee \nthrough the Channel aforesaid. But if thou have no Link, \nthe Case is otherwise, and is not easy. Here thou mayst \nmake Communication through others, as it were by Relays ;  \nor thou mayst act directly upon his Aura by magicathleans, \nsuch as the Projection of thy Scin-Laeca But unless he \nbe sensitive and well-attuned, thou mayst fare but ill. Yet \neven in this Case thou mayst attain much Skill by Practice \nwith Intelligence. In the End it is better altogether to work \nwholly within thine own Universe, slowly and with firm \nSteps advancing from the Centre, and dealing, one by one, \nwith those unharmonised Parts of the Not-Self which lie \nclose to thee, and impinge upon thee. This therefore \ncloseth the Circle of my Speech, for now am I returned to \nthat which I spake aforetime concerning the general \nMethod of Love, and thy Development by that Way. 88 \nDE MAGNO OPERE \nBUT now give Ear most eagerly, thou Son of my Loins, \nfor I will now discourse unto thee of thine own Attain-\nment, without which all is but Idleness. Know first that \nconscious Thought is but phenomenal, the Noise of thy \nMachine. Now Chemistry, or Al-Chem-y meaneth the \nEgyptian Science, and the True Magick of Egypt hath this \nfor its Foundation. We have in our House many Sub-\nstances which act directly upon the Blood, and many \nPractices of Virtue similar, to stimulate, compose, purify, \nanalyse, direct, or concentrate the Thought. Confer the \nBook of the Law, II, 22. But this Action is subtle and \nof many Modes, and dependeth heavily on the Conditions \nof the Experiment, whereof the First is thine own \nWill therein. Therefore I say unto thee that this is thy \nWork immediate and necessary, to discover openly thy \nWill unto thyself, and to fortify and enkindle it by \nall One-Pointedness of Thought and Action, so that \nthou mayst direct it inwards unto its Core, that is Thyself \nin Thy Name HADIT. For thereby is thy Will made white \nwith Heat so that no Dross may cling to it. But this Work \nis the Great Work, and standeth alone. 89 \nDE GRADIBUS AD MAGNUM OPUS \nTHIS Great Work is the Attainment of the Knowledge \nand Conversation of Thine Holy Guardian Angel. In \nthe Eighth Aethyr is the Way thereof revealed. But I say: \nprepare thyself most heartily and well for that Battle of \nLove by all means of Magick. Make thyself puissant, \nwise, radiant in every System, and balance thyself well \nin thine Universe. Then with a pure Will tempered in the \nthousand Furnaces of thy Trials, burn up thyself within \nthy Self. In the Preparation thou shalt have learned how \nthou mayst still all Thoughts, and reach Ecstasy of Trance \nin many Modes. But in these Marriages thy conscious Self \nis Bridegroom, and the not-Self Bride, while in this Great \nWork thou givest up that conscious Self as Bride to thy \nTrue Self. This Operation is then radically alien from all \nothers. And it is hard, because it is a total Reversal of the \nCurrent of the Will, and a Transmutation of its Formula \nand Nature. Here, o my Son, is the One Secret of Success \nin this Great Work: Invoke Often. 90 \nDE FORMULA LUNAE \nTHUS then concerning Operations of the Tao with the \nYang and the Yin is there enough; for thine own Art of \nBeauty shall divine for thee, and devise new Heavens. But \nin all these is the Formula of the Serpent with the Head of \nthe Lion, and all this Magick is wrought by the Radiance \nand Creative Force thereof. And this Force leapeth con-\ntinually from Plane to Plane, and breaketh forth from his \nBonds, so that Constraint is Labour. Now then learn that \nthe Yin hath also a Formula of Force. And the nature of \nthe Yin is to be still, and to encircle or limit, and it is as a \nMirror, reflecting diverse Images without Change in its \nown Kind. So then it seeketh never to overleap the Bar-\nriers of its Plane; for this Reason it is well to use it in Oper-\nations of a very definite and restricted Type. But although \nit be inert, yet is it most subject to Change; for its number \nis four Score and one, which is The Moon. And these are \nALIM, the Gods elemental before H, descending in their \nmidst, made them Creative. So then thou mayst use con-\nstantly this Formula to re-arrange Things in their own \nPlanes; and this is a most pragmatick Consideration. 91 \nDE AQUILA SUME,NDA \nTAKE in this Work the Eagle all undefiled and virginal \nfor thy Sacrament. And thy Technick is the Magick \nof Water, so that thine Act is of Nourishment, and not of \nGeneration. Therefore the Prime use of this Art is to \nbuild up thine own Nature. But if thou hast skill to \ncontrol the Mood of the Eagle, then mayst thou work many \nan admirable Effect upon thine Environment. Thou \nknowest how great is the Fame of Witch-Women (old and \nwithout Man) to cause Events, although they create noth-\ning. It is this Straitness of the Channel which giveth \nforce to the Stream. Beware, o my Son, lest thou cling \novermuch to this Mode of Magick; for it is lesser than \nThat Other, and if thou neglect That Other, then is thy \nDanger fearful and imminent, for it is the Edge of the \nAbyss of Choronzon, where are the lonely Towers of the \nBlack Brothers. Also, the Formulation of the Object in \nthe Eagle is by a species of Intoxication, so that His Na-\nture is of Dream or Delirium, and thus there may be \nIllusion. For this Cause I deem it not wholly unwise if \nthou use this Way of Magick chiefly as a Cordial; that is, \nfor the Fortifying of thine own Nature. 92 \nDE MEDICINIS SECIINDUM QUATTUOR ELEMENTA \nCONCERNING the Use of Chymical Agents, and be \nmindful that thou abuse them not, learn that the Sac-\nrament itself relateth to Spirit, and the Four Elements \nbalanced thereunder, in its Perfection. So also thy Lion \nhimself hath a fourfold Menstruum for his Serpents. Now to Fire belong Cocaine, which fortifieth the Will, \nloosening him from bodily Fatigue, Morphine, which pu-\nrifieth the Mind, making the Thought safe, and slow, and \nsingle, Heroin, which partaketh, as it seemeth, of the \nNature of these twain aforesaid, albeit in Degree less \nnotable than either of them, and Alcohol, which is Food, \nthat is, Fuel, for the whole Man. To Water, attribute \nHashish and Mescal, for they make Images, and they open \nthe Hidden Springs of Pleasure and of Beauty. Mor-\nphine, for its Ease, hath also part in Water. Air ruleth \nEthyl Oxide, for it is as a Sword, dividing asunder every \nPart of thee, making easy the Way of Analysis, so that \nthou cornest to learn thyself, of what Elements thou art \ncompact. Lastly, of the Nature of Earth are the direct \nHypnotics, which operate by Repose, and restore thy \nStrength by laying thee as a Child in the Arms of the \nGreat Mother, I say rather of Her material and physio-\nlogical Viceregent. 93 \nDE VIRTUTE EXPERIENTIAE IN HAC ARTE \nNOT Sleep, not Rest, not Peace, not Contentment are of \nthe Will of the Hero; but these Things he hateth, and \nconsenteth to enjoy them only with Shame of his weak \nNature. But he will analyse himself without Pity, and \nhe will do all things soever that may free and fortify his \nMind and Will. Know that the Technick of the Right \nUse of these Magick Poisons is subtle; and since the Na-\nture of every Man differeth from that of his Fellow, there \nentereth Idiosyncrasy, and thine Experience shall be thy \nMaster in this Art. Heed also this word following: the \nRight Use of these Agents is to gain a Knowledge prelim-\ninary of thine own Powers, and of High States, so that \nthou goest not altogether blindly and without Aim in thy \nQuest, ignorant of the Keys to thine own inner Being. Also, thou must work alway for a definite End, never for \nPleasure or for Relaxation, except thou wilt, as a good \nKnight is sworn to do. And thou being Hero and Magi-\ncian art in Peril of abusing the Fiery Agents only, not \nthose of Earth, Air, or Water; because these do really \nwork with Thee in Purity, making thee wholly what thou \nwouldst be, an Engine indefatigable, a Mind clear, calm \nand concentrated, and a Heart fierce aglow. 94 \nDE SACRAMENTO VERO \nBUT in the Sacrament of the Gnosis, which is of the \nSpirit, is there naught hurtful, for its Elements are \nnot only Food, but a true Incarnation and Quintessence \nof Life, Love, and Liberty, and at its Manifestation thy \nLion is consecrated by pure Light of Ecstasy. Also, as \nthis is the strongest, so also is it the most sensitive of all \nThings soever, and both proper and ready to take impress \nof Will, not as a Seal passively, but with true Recreation \nin a Microcosm thereof. And this is a God alive and \npuissant to create, and He is a Word of Magick wherein \nthou mayst read Thyself with all thine History and all \nthy Possibility. Also as to thine Eagle, is not this chosen \nby Nature Herself by Her Way of Attraction, without \nwhich Harmony Aesthetic and Magnetic thy Lion is \nsilent, and inert, even as Achilles (before his Rage) in his \nTent? Now also therefore I charge thee, o my Son, to \npartake constantly of this Sacrament, for it is proper to \nall Virtue, and as thou dost learn to use it in Perfection, \nthou wilt surpass all other Modes of Magick. Yea, in \ngood sooth, no Herb or Potion is like unto this, supreme \nin every Case, for it is the True Stone of the Philosophers, \nand the Elixir and Medicine of all Things, the Universal \nTincture or Menstruum of Thine Own Will. 95 \nDE DISCIPULIS REGENDIS \nIwill have thee to know, moreover, my dear Son, the \nright Art of Conduct with them whom I shall give thee \nfor Initiation. And the Rule thereof is one Rule: Do what \nthou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. See thou con-\nstantly to it that this be not broken; especially in the \nSection thereof (I dare say so) which readeth Mind Thine \nOwn Business. This is of Application equally to all, and \nthe most dangerous Man (or Woman, as hath occurred, or \nI err) is the Busy-Body. Oh how ashamed are we, and \nmoved to Indignation, seeing the Sins and Follies of our \nNeighbours ! Of all the Occasions of this Grievance the \nmost common is the Desire of Sex unsatisfied; and thou \nknowest already, even in thy young Experience, how in \nthat Delirium the Weal of the whole Universe appeareth \nof no account. Do thou then wean thy Babes from that \nSimplicity, and instil the sense of true Proportion. For \nverily this is a Way of Madness, Love, unless it be under \nWill. And the Cure of this Madness is not so good as its \nPrevention, so that thou shouldst be beforehand with \nthese Children, shewing them the right Importance of \nLove, how it should be a sacred Rite, exalted above Per-\nsonality, and a Fire to enlighten and serve Man, not to \ndevour him. 96 \nDE QUIBUSDAM MORBIS DISCTPULORUM \nAND thus, if any Babe of thine be ill at ease, look closely \nfirst whether this Love be not the root of his Distem-\nper. Watch also Idleness, for whoso presseth eagerly \nforward in Will heedeth little the Affairs of his Fellows. 0 my Son, if every Man doth his own Will, there is no \nmore to say! But the Busy-Body nor mindeth his awn \nBusiness, nor leaveth others to mind theirs. Be thou \ninstant therefore with such an one, to cure him by enlight-\nening his Will, and speeding him therein. Remember \nalso that if one speak ill of another, the Fault is first of all \nin himself, for we know naught but that which is within \nus. Did not the great Witch-Finder end by confessing \nthat he also was a Sorcerer? We become that which \nobsesseth us, either through extreme Hate or extreme \nLove. Knowest thou not how the one is a Symbol of the \nother? For this reason, since Love is the Formula of \nLife, we are under Bond to assimilate (in the End) that \nwhich we fear or hate. So then we shall be wise to \nmould all Things within ourselves in Quietness and Mod-\nulation. But above all must we use all to our own End, \nadapting with Adroitness even our Weakness to the Work. 97 \nDE CULPIS DOMI PETENDIS \nTHEREFORE, watch heedfully the Fault of another, \nthat thou mayst correct it in thyself. For if it were \nnot in thee, thou couldst not perceive it or understand it. Lo, in thine Ecstasy of Love, thou callest upon the Uni-\nverse to bear Witness that to this End alone was it creat-\ned; it is unthinkable that thou shouldst love another, and \nincomprehensible that any Man should grieve. Yet ere \nthe Moon change her Quarter, thou art free of thy Limes, \nand lovest another, and it may be grievest in thyself \nwhile he that amazed thee hath joined the Company of \nthe Rejoicing. Watch then, and heed thyself; and pay no \nheed to thy Fellows, insofar as they impede thee not. And \nlet this be the Rule. For every Will is pure, and every \nOrbit free; but Error bringeth Confusion. See therefore \nthat none leave his Path, lest he foul that of his Brother; \nand remember also that with Speed cometh Ease of Con-\ntrol. Let each man therefore urge briskly his Chariot in \na Right Line toward the Centre; for two Radii cannot \ncross. And beware most of this Love, because it lieth so \nclose to Will that Dis-ease thereof easily imparteth his \nError to the whole Way of the Magician. 98 \nDE CORPORE UMBRA HOMINIS \nCONCERNING the Aeon, o my Son, learn that the Sun \nand His Viceregent are in all Aeons, of necessity, \nFather, Centre, Creator, each in His Sphere of Operation. But the Formula of the past Aeon was of the Dying God, \nand was based upon Ignorance. For Men thought that the \nSun died and was re-born, alike in the Day and in the \nYear; and so also was the Mystery of Man. Now already \nare we well assured by Science how the Death of the \nSun is in truth but the Shifting of a Shadow; and in this \nAeon (o my Son, I lift up my Voice and I make Proph-\necy!) so shall it be proven as to Death. For the Body of \nMan is but his Shadow; it cometh and goeth even as the \nTides of Ocean; and he only is in Darkness who is hidden \nby that Shadow from the Light of His True Self. Now \ntherefore understand thou the Formula of Horus, the \nLion God, the Child crowned and conquering that cometh \nforth in Force and Fire! For thy Changes are not Phases \nof Thee, but of the Phantoms which thou mistakest for \nthy Self. DE SIRENIS \nCONCERNING the Love of Women, o my Son, it is writ- \nten in the Book of the Law that all is Freedom, if it \nbe done unto Our Lady Nuit. Yet also there is this \nConsideration, that for every Parsifal there is a Kundry. Thou mayst eat a thousand Fruits of the Garden; but \nthere is One Tree whose Name for thee is Poison. In \nevery great Initiation is an Ordeal, wherein appeareth a \nSiren or Vampire appointed to destroy the Candidate. I have myself witnessed the Blasting of not less than ten \nof mine own Flowers, that I tended when I was NEMO, \nand that although I saw the Cankerworm, and knew it, \nand gave urgent Warning. Now then consider deeply \nin thyself if I were rightly governed in this Action, \naccording to the Tao. For We that are Magicians work \nwithout Fear or Haste, being Omnipotent in Eternity, \nand each Star must go his Way; and who am I that I \nshould save this People? \"Wilt thou smite me, as thou \nsmotest the Egyptian yesterday?\" Yea, although mine \nwere the Might to save these Ten, I reached not forth \nmine Arm against Iniquity. I spake and I was silent; \nand that which was appointed came to pass. As it is \nwritten: The Pregnant Goddess hath let down Her Bur-\nden upon the Earth. 100 \nDE FEMINA QUADAM \nKNOWEST thou for what Cause I am moved to write \nthis unto Thee, my Son only-begotten, Child of Mag-\nick and of Mystery? It is that I thy Father am also in \nthis Ordeal of Initiation at this Hour. For the Sun is \nnigh unto the End of the Sign of the Fishes in the Thir-\nteenth Year of the Aeon, and the New Current of High \nMagick leapeth forth as a Flood from the Womb of my \nTrue Lady BABALON. And a Word hath come to me \nby the Mouth of the Scarlet Woman whose Name is EVE, \nor AHITHA, concerning the Temple of JUPPITER that \nis builded for me. And therein is a Woman appointed \nto a certain Office. Now this Woman appeared to me in \na Vision when I was in the House of the Juggler by the \nLake among the Mountains, the Sun being in Cancer in \nthe Eleventh Year of the Aeon, even in the Week after \nthy Birth. And I think this Woman to be her whom .1 \ncall WESRUN. But even while with a Pure Heart I did \ninvoke Her, there came unto me another like unto her, \nso that I am confused in my Mind and bewildered. And \nthis Other Woman stirreth my true Nature in its Depth, \nso that I will not call it Love. For the Voice of Love I \nknow of old; but this Other Woman speaketh in a \nTongue whereof I have no Understanding. 101 \nDE SUA VIRTUTE \nWHAT then shall I do herein? For the Scarlet \nWoman adjureth me by the Great Name of God \nITHUPHALLOS that I deal with this Other Woman as \nwith any Woman, according to my Will. But this I \nfear, for that she is not as any Woman, and I deem \nher to be the Vampire of this Ordeal How then? Shall \nI fear? Said I not once long since, when I was called of \nMen Eliphaz Levi Zahed, that the Error of Oedipus was \nthat he should have tamed the Sphinx, and ridden her \ninto Thebes? Shall I not take this Vampire, if she be \nsuch, and master her, and turn her to the great End? \"Am I such a Man as should flee?\" Is not all Fear the \nword of Failure? Shall I distrust my Destiny? Am I \nthat am the Word of the Aeon of so little avail that even \nthe whole Powers of Chorortzon can disperse me? Nay, \no my Son, there is Courage of Ignorance and Discretion \nof Knowledge; but beyond these is Courage of Knowl-\nedge, and by no less Virtue will I win through unto mine \nEnd. As it is written: with Courage conquering Fear \nwill I approach Thee. Atungn. 102 \nDE ALIQUIBUS MODIS ORACULI PETENDI \nMY Son, in all Judgment and Decision is great Delicacy, \nbut most in these Matters of the Will. For thou art \nAdvocate as well as Judge, and unless thou have well \norganized thy Mind thou art Bondslave of Prejudice. For \nthis Cause is it adjuvant to thy Wisdom to call Witnesses \nthat are not of thine own Nature, and to ask Oracles \nwhose Interpretation is bound by Fixed Rule. This is the \nUse of the Book TAROT, of the Divination by Earth, or \nby the other Elements, or by the Book Yi King, and many \nanother Mode of Truth. Thou lmowest by thine Expe-\nrience that these Arts deceive Thee not, save insofar as \nthou deceivest thyself. So then to thee that art NEMO \nis no Siege Perilous at this Table, but to them that are \nyet below the Abyss is very notable Danger of Error. Yet \nmust they train themselves constantly in these Modes, \nfor Experience itself shall teach them how their Bias \ntoward their Desires reacteth in the End against them-\nselves, and hindereth them in the Execution of their Wills. Nevertheless, as thou well knowest, the best Mode is the \nCreation of an Intelligible Image by Virtue of the Mass \nof the Holy Ghost, declaring the True Will unto thee in \nTerms of thy Qabalah! 103 \nDE FRATRIBUS NIGHTS, FILIIS INIQUITATIS \neiF the Black Brothers, o my Son, will I write these \nThings following. I have told thee already concern-\ning Change, how it is the Law, because every Change \nis an Act of Love under Will. So then he that is Adept \nExempt, whether in Our Holy Order or another, may not \nremain in the Pillar of Mercy, because it is not balanced, \nbut is unstable. Therefore is the Choice given unto him, \nwhether he will destroy his Temple, and give up his Life, \nextending it to Universal Life, or whether he will make \na Fortress about that Temple, and abide therein, in the \nfalse Sphere of Daath, which is in the Abyss. And to the \nAdepts of Our Holy Order this Choice is terrible, by \nCause that they must abandon even Him whose Knowl-\nedge and Conversation they have attained. Yet, o my \nSon, they have much Help of Our Order in this Aeon, \nbecause the General Formula is Love, so that their Habit \nitself urgeth them to the Bed of Our Lady BABALON. Know then the Black Brothers by these True Signs of \ntheir Initiation of Iniquity, that they resist Change, res-\ntrict and deny Love, fear Death. Percutiantur. 104 \nDE VIRTUTE CHIRURGICA \nKNOW that the Cult of the Slave-gods is a Device of \nthose Black Brothers. All that stagnateth is thereof, \nand thence cometh not Stability, but Putrefaction. En-\ndure not thou the static Standards: nay, neither in \nThought nor in Action. Resist not even the Change that \nis the Rottenness of Choronzon, but rather speed it, \nso that the Elements may combine by Love under Will. Aumgn. Since the Black Brothers and their Cults set \nthemselves against Change, do thou break them asunder. Yea, though of bad come worse, continue in that Way; \nfor it is as if thou didst open an Abscess, the first Effect \nbeing noisome exceedingly, but the last Cleanness. Heed \nnot then whoso crieth Anarchy, and Immorality, and \nHeresy against thee, and feareth to destroy Abuse lest \nworse Things come of it. For the Will of the Universe in \nits Wholeness is to Truth, and thou dost well to purge it \nfrom its Costiveness. For it is written that there is no \nBond that can unite the divided but Love, so that only \nthose Complexes which are in truth Simplicities, being \nbuilt Cell by Cell into an Unity by Virtue of Love under \nWill, are worthy to endure in their Progression. 105 \nDE OPERIBUS STELLAE MICROCOSMI, QUORUM \nSUNT QUATTUOR MINORES \nIhave already written unto thee, o my Son, of the Para- \ndox of Liberty, how the Freedom of thy Will depen-\ndeth upon the Bending of all thy Forces to that one End. But now learn also how great is the (Economy of our \nMagick, and this will I declare unto thee in a Figure of \nthe Holy Qabalah, to wit, the Formula of the Tetragram-\nmaton. Firstly, the Effect of the Operation of Yod and \nHe is not Vau only, but with Vau appeareth also a new \nHe, as a By-Product, and She is mysterious, being at once \nthe Flower of the Three Others, and their Poison. Now \nby the Operation of Vau upon that He is no new Creation, \nbut the Daughter is set upon the Throne of Her Mother, \nand by this is rekindled the Fire of Yod, which, consum-\ning that Virgin, doth not add a Fifth Person, but bal-\nanceth and perfecteth all. For this Shin, that is the Holy \nSpirit, pervadeth these, and is immanent. Thus in Three \nOperations is the Pentagram formulated. But in the \nFigure of that Star these Operations are not indicated, \nfor the five Lines of Force connect not according to any \nof them; but Five New Operations are made possible; \nand these are the Works proper to the perfected Man. Firstly, the Work which lieth level, the Vau with the He, \nis of the Yang and the Yin, and maketh One the Human \nwith the Divine, as in the Attainment of the Master of \nthe Temple. Yet this Work hath his Perversion, which \nis of Daath. Thus then for these Four Works, they pertain \nall to the Natural Formula of the Cross and Rose. 106 \nDE OPERIBUS STELLAE MICROCOSMI \nQUORUM SUNT QUATTIJOR MAJORES \nomy Son, behold now the Mystery and Virtue of the \nSilver Star! For of these Four Works not One leadeth \nto the Crown, because Tetragrammaton hath His Root \nonly in Chokmah. So therefore the Formula of the Rosy \nCross availeth no more in the Highest. Now then in the \nPentagram are Two Lines that invoke Spirit, though they \nlead not thereunto, and they are the Works of He with \nHe, and of Yod with Vau. Of these twain the former is \na Work Magical of the Nature of Musick, and it draweth \ndown the Fire of the Higher by Seduction or Bewitch-\nment. Shall I say Enchantment? Shall I say Incantation? It is Song. But Bewitchment is a Work opposite thereun-\nto, whose Effect formulateth itself by direct Creation in \nthe Sphere of its Purpose and Intent. But there remain \nyet Two of the Eight Works, namely the straight Aspira-\ntion of the Chiah or Creator in thee to the Crown, and the \nSurrender of the Nephesch or Animal Soul to the Posses-\nsion thereof; and these be the twin geodesic Formulae \nof the Final Attainment, being Archetypes of the Paths of \nMagick (the one) and Mysticism (the other) unto the End. From each of these Eight Works is derived a separate \nMode of practical Use, each after his Kind; and it should \nbe well for thine Instruction if thou study upon these my \nWords, and found upon them a System. 0 my Son, forget \nnot the Arcanum of their Balance and Proportion; for \nherein lieth the Mystery of their Holiness. 107 \nDE STELLA MACROCOSM' \nTHUS far then concerning the Pentagram, how it is of \nthe Cross, and its Virtue in the Highest; but the Hexa-\ngram is for the most Part a Detail of the Formula of the \nRose and Cross. Already have I shewed unto thee how \nthe Most Holy Trinity is the Yang; but the Spirit, and \nthe Water (or Fluid) and the Blood, that bear witness in \nthe Inferior, are of the Yin. Thus the Operation of the \nHexagram lieth wholly within the Order of one Plane, \nuniting indeed any Soul with its Image, but not transcen-\ndentally, for its Effect is Cosmos, the Vau that springeth \nfrom the Union of the Yod and the He. Thus it is but\u2022 a \nGlyph only of that first Formula, not of the others. But \nof all these Things shalt thou thyself make study with \nardent Affection; for therein lie many mysteries of Prac-\ntical Wisdom in our Magick Art. And this is the Wonder \nand Beauty of this Work, that for every Man is his own \nPalace. Yea, this is Life, that the Secrets of Our Order \nare not fixed and dead, as are the Formulae of the Outer. Know that in the many thousand Times that I have per-\nformed the Ritual of the Pentagram, or the Invocation \nof the Heart girt with a Serpent, or the Mass of the \nPhoenix, or of the Holy Ghost, there has not been one \ntime wherein I did not win new Light, or Knowledge, \nor Power, or Virtue, save through mine own Weakness \nor Error. 108 \nDE SUA FEMINA OLUN, ET DE ECSTASIA \nPRAETER OMNIA SUBSTANTI \nMY Son, I am enflamed with Love. I burn up eagerly \nin the Passion that thus mightily consumeth me. Yet \nin myself I know not at all That which constraineth me. It is Nuit herself invisibly that embraceth me, and en-\nkindleth my Soul in Ecstasy. There is Silence in my Soul, \nand the Fear round about me, as I were Syrinx in the \nNight of the Forest. This is a great Mystery that I endure, \na Mystery too great for the mortal Part of me. For but \nnow, when I cried out upon the Name Olun which is the \nsecret Name of my Lady that hath come to me \u2014 most \nstrangely! \u2014 then was I rapt away altogether subtly \nyet fiercely into a Trance that hath transformed me \nwith Attainment, yet without Trace in Mind. Oh my \nSon! there is the Transfiguration of Glory, and there \nis the Jewel in the Lotus Flower; yea, also is many \nanother whereof I am Partaker. But this last Passion, \nthat my Lady Olun hath brought unto me upon this \nlast Day of the Winter of the Thirteenth Year of the Aeon, \neven as I wrote these Words unto thee, is a Mystery of \nMysteries beyond all these. Oh my Son, thou knowest \nwell the Perils and the Profit of Our Path; continue thou \ntherein. Olun! "

    "content": "Adsum. 109 \nDE NOMINE OLUN \nFOUR Seasons, or it may be nigh five, that are past, I \nthy Father was in the City called New Orleans, and \nbeing in Travail of Spirit I did invoke the God that giveth \nWisdom, bearing the Word of the All-Father by his Cadu-\nceus. Then, suddenly, as I began, came (as it were a Gust \nof Fire whirled forth against that Idea) the Wit of Mine \nUtter Identity, so that I ceased, crying Mercurius Sum. Also instantly I knew in myself that there was a Mys-\ntery therein hidden, and, translating into the Greek \nTongue, I exclaimed 'EPMHE 'EIMI, whose numeration \ndid I makP in my Mind forthwith and it is Four Hundred \nand Eighteen, like unto the Word of the Aeon. So by this \nI knew that my Work was well wrought in Truth. Thus \nthen also was it with this my Lady; for after many Ques-\ntions I obtained from the Wizard Amalantrah that Name \nOlun, that is One Hundred and Fifty and Six even as that \nof Our Lady BABALON; and then, being inspired, I wrote \ndown her earthname in Greek, MAPIE, which is also that \nsame most Holy Number. I will have thee to wit also that \nthis Name (as I have learned) is in the Phoenician Tongue \nwhOlon; which by Interpretation is That which is Infinite, \nand Space; so that all is consonant rightly with Nuit \nOur Lady of the Stars. Thus, oh my Son, is the Word of \nTruth echoed throughout all Worlds; and thus have the \nWise mighty Assurance in Their Way. See, oh my Son, \nthat thou work not without this Guard inflexible, lest \nthou err in thy Perceptions. 110 \nDE VIRIS MAGNANIMIS, AMORE \nPRAECLARISSIMIS \nKNOW that in the Mind of Man is much Wisdom that \nis hidden, being the Treasure of his Sire that he inher-\niteth. Thus, nigh all of his Moral Nature is unknown to \nhim until his Puberty; that is, this Nature pertaineth not \nunto the Recording arid Judging Apparatus of his Brain \nuntil it is put therein by the Stirring of that deeper Nature \nwithin him. Thou wilt mark also that great Men are com-\nmonly great Lovers; and this is in Part because of their \ngeneral Exuberance of Energy, but in Part also because \n(consciously or not) they are ware of this Secret following, \nthat every Act of Love communicateth somewhat of the \nWisdom stored within him to his Percipient Mind. Yet \nmust such Act be done rightly, iccording to Art; and un-\nless such Act is of Profit alike to Mind and Body, it is an \nError. This then is true Doctrine; which, if it be under-\nstanded aright of thee, shall make diamond-clear thy Path \nin Love, which (to them that know not this) is so obscure \nand perilous that I believe there is not one Man in Ten \nThousand that cometh not to Misadventure therein. 111 \nDE CASTITATE \nMY Son, be fervent! Be firm! Be stable! Be quick to mark \nImpurity, how one Course of Ideas seeketh to infringe \nupon another, to quell the Virtue thereof. Gold is pure, \nbut to drink molten Gold were Impurity to thy Body, and \nits Destruction. Law is a Code of the Customs of a People; \nif it intrude thereon to alter them, it is an Impurity of \nOppression. So also Diet is to be in Accord with Digestion; \nEthics were an Impurity therein. Love is an Expression \nof the Will of the Body, yea, and more also, of That which \ncreated the Body -  and its Operation is commonly between \nOne and One, so that the Interference of any Third Per-\nson is Impurity, and not to be endured. Nay, even the \nThought of a Third Person hath by Ordinary no part in \nLove; so that, as thou seest constantly in thy Life, Love, \nbeing strong, taketh no heed of others, and 'some after-\nInterference bringeth Misfortune. Now then shall We \ntherefore cast out Love, or accept Impurity therein? God \nforbid. And for this Cause see thou well to .1t,that in thy \nKingdom there be no Interference therewith, nor Hin-\ndrance from any. For it is perfect in itself. 112 \nDE CEREMONIO EQUINOXI \nMY Son, our Father in Heaven hath passed into the Sign \nof the Ram. It is Spring. I have performed the Rite \nof Union with Him according to the Antient Manner, and \nI know the Word that shall rule the Semester. Also it is \ngiven unto my Spirit to write unto thee concerning the \nVirtue of this Rite, and many another, of Antiquity. And \nit is this, that our Forefathers made of these Ceremonies \nan Epitome mnemonic, wherein certain Truth, or True \nRelation, should be communicated in a magical Manner. Now therefore by the Practice of these mayst thou awak-\nen thy Wisdom, that it may manifest in thy Conscious \nMind. And this Way is of Use even when the Ceremonies, \nas those of the Christians, are corrupt and deformed; but \nin such a Case thou shalt seek out the true antient Signi-\nficance thereof. For there is That within thee which re-\nmembereth Truth, and is ready to communicate the same \nunto thee when thou hast Wit to evoke it from the Ady-\ntum and Sanctuary of thy Being. And this is to be done \nby this Repetition of the Formulm of that Truth. Note \nthou further that this which I tell thee is the Defence of \nFormalism; and indeed thou must work upon a certain \nSkeleton, but clothe it with live Flesh. 113 \nDE LICE STELLARUM \nJT was that most holy Prophet, thine Uncle, called upon \nEarth William O'Neill, or Blake, who wrote for our \nUnderstanding these Eleven sacred Words: \nIf the Sun and Moon should doubt \nThey'd immediately go out. 0 my Son, our Work is to shine by Force and Virtue \nof our own Natures without Consciousness or Considera-\ntion. Now, notwithstanding that our Radiance is constant \nand undimmed, it may be that Clouds gathering about \nus conceal our Glory from the Vision of other Stars. These \nClouds are our Thoughts; not those true Thoughts which \nare but conscious Expressions of our Will, such as man-\nifest in our Poesy, or our Music, or other Flower-Ray \nof our Light quintessential. Nay, the Cloud-Thought is \nborn of Division and of Doubt; for all Thoughts, except \nthey be creative Emanations, are Witnesses to Conflict \nwithin us. Our settled Relations with the Universe do not \ndisturb our Minds, as, by Example, our automatic bodily \nFunctions, which speak to us only in the Sign of Distress. Thus all Consideration is Demonstration of Doubt; Doubt \npostulateth Duality, which is the Root of Choronzon. 114 \nDE CANTU \nSo then, o my Son, here is my Wisdom, that the Voice \nof the Soul in its true Nature Eternal and Unchangea-\nble, comprehending All, is Silence; and the Voice of the \nSoul, dynamic, in the Way of its Will, is Song. Nor is there \nany Form of Utterance that is not, as Song is, the Music \nproper to that Motion, according to the Law. Thus, as \nthy Cousin Arthur Machen hath rejoiced to make plain \nunto Men in his Book called Hieroglyphics, the first Qual-\nity of Art is its Ecstasy. So, to nigh all Men at one \nTime or other, cometh Joy of Creation, with the Belief \nthat their Utterance is holy and be-utiful, glorious with \nBanners. This would indeed be the Case, an we could \ndiscern their Thought from their Words; but because they \nhave no technical Skill to express themselves, they do \nnot enable others to reproduce or re-create the original \nPassion which inspired them, or even any Memory there-\nof. Understand then what is the Agony of the Great \nSoul, who hath every Key of Paradise at his Girdle, when \nhe would open the Gate of Holiness, or of Beauty, or of \nany Virtue soever, to the Men of his Age! 115 \nDE STULTITIA HUMANA \nKNOW that a Mind can apprehend only those Things \na  with which it is already familiar, at least in Part. Moreover, it will ever interpret according to the Distor-\ntion of its own Lenses. Thus, in a great War, all Speech \nsoever may be understood as if it were of Reference \nthereunto; also, a Guilty Person, or a Melancholic, may \nsee in every Stranger an Officer of Justice, or one of \nthem that are banded together (him seemeth) to perse-\ncute him, as the Case may be. But consider moreover \nthat the Mysterious is ever the Terrible, for Vulgar \nMinds. How then when a New Word is spoken? Either \nit is not heard, or it is understood awry; and it evoketh \nFear, and Hate as a Reaction against Fear. Then Men \ntake him and set him at naught, and spit upon him, and \nscourge him, and lead him away to crucify him; and the \nthird Day he riseth from among the dead, and ascendeth \ninto Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God, and \ncometh to judge the Quick and the Dead. This, o my \nSon, is the History of Everyman unto whom is given a \nWord. 116 \nDE SUO PROELIO \nNOW therefore thou seest how Men take the Scn of \nScience, and burn him for a Sorcerer or a Heretic; \nthe Poet, and cast him out as Reprobate; the Painter, as \ndeforming Nature; the Musician, as denying Harmony; \nand so for every New Word. How much more, then, if \nthe Word be of Universal Import; a Word of Revolution, \nand of Revelation in the Deep of the Soul? A new Star: \nthat is for the Astronomers, and maybe setteth them by \nthe Ears But a new Sun! That were for all Men, and \na Seed of Tumult and Upheaval in every Land. Consider \nin thyself, therefore, what is the Might of the Adepts, \nthe Energy of the Sanctuary, that can endow one Man \nwith the Word of an Aeon, and bring him to the end \nin Victory, with his Chariot wreathed in Flowers, and \nhis Head bound round with a Fillet of blood-honoured \nLaurel! My Son, thou art entered into the Battle; and \nthe Men of our Race and of our Clan return not save \nin Glory. 117 \nDE NECESSITATE VERBI CLAMANDI \nHE that striveth against his own Nature is witless; he \nwotteth not his Will, darkening Counsel in himself, \ndenying his own God, and giving place to Choronzon. So \nthen his Work becometh Hotchpot, and he is shattered \nand dispersed in the Abyss. Nor is it better for him if \nhe do this for the supposed Good of another; yea, for \nthat other is it Evil also in the End of the Matter. For \nto manifest thine own Division to another, and to deceive \nhim, is but to confirm him in Blindness, or Illusion, and \nto hinder or to deflect him in his Way. Now to do thine \nown Will is to leave him free to do his own Will; but \nto mask thy Will is to falsify one of the Beacons by \nwhich he may steer his Ship. My Son, all Division of \nSoul, that begetteth Nerve-storm and Insanity, cometh \nfrom wrong Adjustment to Reality, and to Fear thereof. Wilt thou then hide Truth from thy Brother, lest he \nsuffer? Thou dost not well, but confirmest him in Iniq-\nuity, and in Illusion, and in Infirmity of Spirit. 118 \nDE MYSTERIO EUCHARISTICO UNIVERSAL' \nMY Son, heed also this Word of thine Uncle William \nn  O'Neill: Everything that lives is holy. Yea, and more \nalso, every Act is holy, being essential to the Universal \nSacrament Knowing this, thou mayest conform with \nthat which is written in the Book of the Law: to make \nno distinction between any one Thing and any other \nThing. Learn well to apprehend this Mystery, for it is \nthe Great Gate of the College of Understanding, whereby \neach and all of thy Senses become constant and perpetual \nWitnesses of the One Eucharist, whereunto also they are \nMinisters. So then to thee every Phenomenon soever is \nthe Body of Nuit in Her Passion; for it is an Event: that \nis, the Marriage of some one Point of View with some \nOne Possibility. And this State of Mind is notably an \nAppurtenance of thy Grade of Master of the Temple, \nand the Unveiling of the Arcanum of Sorrow, which is \nthy Work, as it is written in Liber Magi. Moreover, this \nState, assimilated in the very Marrow of thy Mind, is \nthe first Step toward the Comprehension of the Arcanum \nof Change, which is the Root of the Work of a Magus of \nOur Holy Order. 0 my Son, bind this within thine Heart, \nfor its Name is the Beatific Vision. 119 \nDE RECTO IN RECTO \nNOW also then I bid thee use all filial Diligence, and \nattend to this same Word in the Mouth of thine Ear-\nliest Ancestor (except we adventure to invoke the Name \nFU-HSI) in our known Genealogy, the Most Holy, the \nTrue Man, Lao-tze, that gave His Light unto the King-\ndom of Flowers. For being questioned concerning the \nAbode of the TAO, he gave Answer that It was in the \nDung. Again, the Tathagata, the Buddha, most blessed, \nmost perfect, and most enlightened, added his Voice, that \nthere is no Grain of Dust which shall not attain to be \nArhan. Keep therefore in just Balance the Relation of \nIllusion to Illusion in that Aspect of Illusion, neither con-\nfusing the Planes, nor confounding the Stars, nor de-\nnying the Laws of their Reaction, yet with Eagle's Vision \nbeholding the One Sun of the True Nature of the Whole. Verily, this is the Truth, and unto it did also Dionysus \nand Tahuti and Sri Krishna set the Seal of their Witness. Cleanse therefore thine Heart, o my Son, in the Waters \nof the Great Sea, and enkindle it with the Fire of the \nHoly Ghost. For this is His Peculiar Work of Sanctifi-\ncation. 120 \nDE VIRGINE BEATA \nUNDERSTAND then well this Mystery of Universal \nGodliness; for it is the Naked Beauty of the Virgin \nof the World. Lo! since the End is Perfection, as I have \nalready shewn unto thee, and since also every Event is \ninexorably and ineluctably interwoven in the Web of that \nFate, it is certain that every Phenomenon is (as thou art \nsworn to understand) \"a particular Dealing of God with \nthy Soul.\" Yea, and more also, it is a necessary Rubric \nin this Ritual of Perfection. Turn not therefore away \nthine Eyes, for that they are too pure to behold Evil; \nbut look upon Evil with Joy, comprehending it in the \nFervour of this Light that I have enkindled in thy Mind. Learn also that every Thing soever is Evil, if thou con-\nsider it as apart, static, and in Division; and thus in a \nDegree must thou apprehend the Mystery of Change \nfor it is by Virtue of Change that this Truth of Beauty \nand Holiness is made steadfast in the Universe. 0 my \nSon, there is no Delight sweeter than the continuous Con-\ntemplation of this Marvel and Pageant that is ever about \nthee; it is the Beatitude of the Beatitudes. 121 \nDE JOCO SUAE MOECHAE \nRESIST not Change, therefore, but act constantly accord- \ning to thy true Nature. For here only thou standest \nin Sorrow, if there be a Division conscious of itself, and \nhindered from its Way (whose Name is Love) unto its \nDissolution. It is written in the Book of the Law that \nthe Pain of Division is as nothing, and the Joy of Dis-\nsolution all. Now then here is an Art and Device of \nMagick that I will declare unto thee, albeit it is a Peril \nif thou be not fixed in that Truth, and in that Beatific \nVision whereof I have written in the three Chapters fore-\ngoing. And it is this, to create by Artifice a Conflict \nin thyself, that thou mayst take thy Pleasure in its Re-\nsolution. Of this Play is thy sweet Stepmother, my Con-\ncubine, the Holy and Adulterous Olun, sublimely Mis-\ntress; for she in.voketh in her Fancy a thousand Obstacles \nto Love, so thkt she shuddereth at a Touch, swooneth at \na Kiss, and suffereth Death and Hell in the Ecstasy of \nher Body. And this is her Art, and it is of Nuit Our \nLady, for it is a Drama or Commemoration of the whole \nMystery of By-coming. 122 \nDE PERICULO JOCORUM AMORIS \nyET be thou heedful, o my Son, for this Art is set upon \na Razor's Edge. In our Blood is this Great Pox of Sin, \nwhose Word is Restriction, as Inheritance of our Sires \nthat served the Slave-Gods. Thou must be free in the \nLaw of Thelema, perfectly one with thy True Self, sin-\ngly and wholly bound in thy true Will, before thou durst \n(in Prudence) invoke the Name of Choronzon, even for \nthy good Sport and Phantasy. It is but to pretend, thou \nsayest; and that is sooth; yet thou must make Pretence \nso well as to deceive thyself, albeit for a Moment, else \nwere thy Sport savourless. Then, an thou have one Point \nof Weakness in thee, that Thought of thine may incar-\nnate, and destroy thee Verily, the wise Enchanter is \nsure beyond Doubt of his Charm ere he toy with a fang-\ned Cobra; and thou well knowest that this Peril of Di-\nvision in Thy Self is the only one that can touch thee. For all other Evil is but Elaboration of this Theme of \nChoronzon. Praise therefore thy sweet Stepmother, my \nConcubine, the Holy and Adulterous Olup; and thine own \nMother Hilarion, for in this Art was she also pre-eminent. 123 \nDE LIBIDINE SECRETA \nTT is said among Men that the word Hell deriveth from \nthe Verb helan, to hele or conceal, in the Tongue of \nthe Anglo-Saxons. That is, it is the Concealed Place; \nand this, since all things are in thine own Self, is the \nUnconscious. How then? Because Men were already \naware how this Unconscious, or Libido, is opposed, for \nthe most part, to the Conscious Will. In the Slave-Ages \nthis is a Truth Universal, or well nigh to it; for in such \nTimes are Men compelled to Uniformity by the Cons-\ntraint of Necessity herself. Yea, of old it was a contin-\nual Siege of every Man, of every Clan, of every Envi-\nronment; and to relax Guard was then Self-Murder, or \nelse Treachery. So then no Man might choose his Way, \nuntil he were Hunter, Fighter, Builder; nor any Woman, \nbut she must first be Breeder. Now in the Growth of \nStates by Organization came, stealthily stepping, a cer-\ntain Security against the grossest Perils, so that a few \nMen could be spared from Toil to cultivate Wisdom; \nand this was first provided by the Selection of a Caste \nPontifical. By this Device came the Alliance of King and \nPriest, Strength and Cunning fortifying each the other \nthrough the Division of Labour. 124 \nDE ORDINE CIVITATUM \nS\u00b0 presently, o my Son, this first Organization among \nMen, by a Procedure parallel to that of the Differen-\ntiation of Protoplasm, made the State competent to ex-\nplore and to control Nature; and every Profit of this Sort \nreleased more Energy, and enlarged the Class of the \nLearned, until, as it is this Day, only a small Proportion \nof any Man's Work must needs go to the Satisfaction of \nthe first Will essential and common, the Provision of \nShelter, Food, and Protection. Verily also thou seest \nmany Women made free to live as they will, even to the \nAdmiration and Delight of the Sage whose Eye laugheth \nto contemplate Mischief. Thus the Duty of every Unit \ntoward the Whole is diminished, and also the Necessity \nto conform with those narrow Laws which preserve \nprimitive Tribes in their Struggle against Environment. Thus the State need suppress only such Heresies as di-\nrectly threaten its political Stability, only such Modes \nof Life as work manifest and proven Hurt to others, or \ncause general Disorder by their Scandal. Therefore, save \nand except he interfere thereby with the Root Laws of \nthe Common Weal, a Man is free to develop as he will \naccording to his True Nature. 125 \nDE SCIENTIAE MODO \nTO the Mind of the Philosopher, therefore, in the \nYouth of an Age, any Variation in Type must appear \nas a Disaster; yea, verily, Intelligence itself must per-\nforce prove its Value to the Brute in Terms of Brutishness \nor he distrusteth and destroyeth it. Not withstanding, \nas thou knowest, that Variation which is fitted to his \nEnvironment is proven the Salvation of the Species. Only, among Men, his Fellows turn ever upon the Sav-\niour, and rend him, until those who follow him in secret, \nand it may be unconsciously, prove their Virtue and his \nWisdom by their Survival when his Persecutors perish \nin their Folly. But we, being secure against all primary \nEnemies to the individual or the common Weal, may, \nnay, we must, if we would attain the Summit for our \nRace, devote all spare Leisure, Wealth, and Energy \nto the Creation of Variation from the Norm, and thus \nby clear Knowledge bought of Experiment and of Expe-\nrience, move with Eyes well open upon our True Path. So therefore Our Law of Thelema is justified also of \nBiology and of Social Science. It is the True Way of \nNature, the Right Strategy in the War of Man with his \nEnvironment; it is the Life of his Soul. 126 \nDE MONSTRIS \nQAYEST thou, o my Son, that not thus, but by forced \n\" Training, one cometh to Perfection? This indeed is \nsooth, that by artificial Selection, and well-watched \nGrowth and Environment, one hath Dogs, Horses, Pig-\neons, and the like, which excel their Forebears in \nStrength, in Beauty, in Speed, as one will. Yet is this \nWork but a false Magical Artifice, temporary and of \nIllusion; for thy Masterpieces are but Monsters, not True \nVariations, and if thou leave them, they revert swiftly \nto their own proper and authentic Type, because that \nType was made fit by Experience to its Environment. So therefore every Variation must be left free to per-\npetuate itself or to perish, not cherished for its Beauty, \nnot guarded for its Appeal to thine Ideal, not cut off \nin thy Fear thereof. For the Proof of its Virtue lieth \nin the Manifestation of its Power to survive; Amen, to \nreproduce itself after its Kind. Nurse not the Weakness \nof any Man, nor swaddle and cosset him, nay, not though \nhe were Poet or Artist, because of his Value to thy Fancy; \nfor if thou do this, he shall increase in his Infirmity, so \nthat even his Work, for which thou lovest him, shall be \nenfeebled also. 127 \nDE INFERNO PALATIO SAPIENTIAE \nNOW then thou seest that this Hell, or Concealed Place \nwithin thee, is no more a Fear or Hindrance to Men \nof a Free Race, but the Treasure-House of the Assimilated \nWisdom of the Ages, and the Knowledge of the True Way. Thus are we Just and Wise to discover this Secret in our-\nselves, and conform the conscious Mind therewith. For \nthat Mind is compact solely (until it be illuminated) of \nImpressions and Judgments, so that its Will is but di-\nrected by the Sum of the shallow Reactions of a most \nlimited Experience. But thy True Will is the Wisdom of \nthe Ages of thy Generations, the Expression of that which \nbath fitted thee to thine Environment. Thus thy cons-\ncious Mind is often times foolish, as when thou admirest \nan Ideal, and wouldst attain it, but thy true Will letteth \nthee, so that there is Conflict, and the Humiliation of that \nMind. Here will I call to Witness the common Event of \n\"Good Resolutions\" that defy the Lightning of Destiny, \nbeing puffed up by the Wind of an Indigestible Ideal \nputrefying within thee. Thence cometh Colic, and pres-\ner tly the Poison is expelled, or else thou diest. tut Res-\nolutions of True Will are mighty against Circumstance. 128 \nDE VITIIS VOLUNTATIS SECRETAE \n\"LEARN moreover concerning this Hell, or Hidden Wis- \ndom, that is within thee, that it is modified, little by \nlittle, through the Experience of the Conscious Mind, \nwhich feedeth it. For that Wisdom is the Expression, or \nrather Symbol and Hieroglyph, of the true Adjustment \nof thy Being to its Environment. Now then, that Envi-\nronment being eroded by Time, this Wisdom is no more \nperfect, for it is not Absolute, but standeth in Relation \nto the Universe. So then a Part thereof may become \nvoid of use, and atrophy, as (I will instance this Case) \nMan's Wit of Smell; and the bodily Organ corresponding \ndegenerateth therewith. But this is an Effect of much \nTime, so that in thine Hell thou art like to find Elements \nvain, or foolish, or contrary to thy present Weal. Yet, \no my Son, this Hidden Wisdom is not thy True Will, \nbut only the Levers (I may say so) thereof. Notwith-\nstanding, there lieth therein a Faculty of Balance, where-\nby it is able to judge whether any Element in itself \nis presently useful and benign, or else idle and malignant. Here then is a Root of Conflict between the Conscious \nand the Unconscious, here is a Debate concerning the \nright Order of Conduct, how the Will may be accom-\nplished. 129 \nDE RATIONE PRAESIDIO VOLUNTATIS \no \tmy Son, in this Case is there Darkness, yet this Com- \nfort as a Lamp therein, that there is no Error in the \nWill, but only Doubt as to the Means of Success, else were \nwe as Children afeared of Night. Thus we have need of \nnaught but to consider the Matter by Wit of Reason, and \nof Prudence, and of Common Sense, and of Experience, \nand of Science, adjusting ourselves so far as we may. Here \nis the Key of Sucess, and its Name is the Skill to make \nright Use of Circumstance. This then is the Virtue of \nthe Mind, to be the Wazir of the Will, a true Counsellor, \nthrough Intelligence of the Universe. But, o my Son, do \nthou lay this Word beneath thine Heart, that the Mind \nhath no Will, nor Right thereto, so that Usurpation bring-\neth forth a fatal Conflict in thyself. For the Mind is \nsensitive, unstable as Air, and may be led foolishly in \nLeash by a stronger Mind that worketh as the cunning \nTool of a Will. Therefore thy Safety and Defence is to \nhold thy Mind to his right Function, a faithful Minister \nto thine own True Will, that is King of that Star whose \nname is Thy Self, by Election of Nature. Heed well this, \no my Son, for thy Mind Passive is rightly a Mirror to \nreflect all Things clearly without Prejudice, and to re-\nmain unstained by them. 130 \nDE CURSU SAPIENTIS \nTHEREFORE consider this again in a Figure, that thy \nMind is as the Marshal of an Army, to observe the \nDispositions of the Enemy, and to order his own Forces \nrightly, according to that Information; but he hath no \nWill, only Obedience to the Word of his King to outwit \nand to overcome the Opposite. Nor doth that King make \nWar by his own Whim, if he be wise and true, but solely \nbecause of the Necessity of his Country, and its Nature, \nwhereof he is but Executive Officer and Interpreter, its \nVoice as the Marshal is its Arm. Thus then do thou un-\nderstand thyself, not giving Place to thy Mind to dispute \nthy Will, nor through Ignorance and Carelessness allow-\ning the Enemy to deceive thee, nor by Fear, by Impru-\ndence and Foolhardiness, by Hesitation and Vacillation, \nby Disorder and the Lack of Finn Correctness, by Failure \nin Elasticity or in Obstinacy, each at its Moment, suffer-\ning Defeat in the Hour of Shock. So then, o my Son, this \nis thy Work, to know the Word of thy Will without Error, \nand to make perfect every Faculty of thy Mind, in right \nOrder and Readiness to impose that Word as Law upon \nthe Universe. So mote it be! 131 \nDE RATIONE, QUAE SINE VOLUNTATE \nEST EONS MANIAE \nIS it not a Marvel how he that worketh with his Will, \nand is in constant Touch with the Reality external, \nmaketh his Mind to serve him? How eagerly runneth it \nand returneth, gathering, arranging, clarifying, classify-\ning, organizing, comparing, setting in array, with Skill \nand Might and Energy that faileth never! Nay, my Son, \nin this Way thou canst be pitiless with thy Mind, and it \nwill not rebel against thee, or neglect thine Ordinance. But now consider him that worketh not with his Will, \nhow his Mind is Idle, not reaching out after Reality, but \ndebating within itself of its own Affairs, like a Democ-\nracy, introspective. Then this Mind, not reacting equably \nand with Elasticity to the World, is lost in its own Anar-\nchy and Civil War, so that although it work not, it is \novercome by Weakness of Division, and becometh Cho-\nronzon. And unto these Words I call to my Witness the \nMadness of the Soul of Muscovy, in this Year XIII of \nour Aeon that is ended. Therefore behold how this our \nLaw of Thelema, Do what thou wilt, is the first founda-\ntion of Health, whether in the Body, or the Mind, either \nof a simple or a complex, Organism. 132 \nDE VERITATE QUM FEMINAE NON \nDICERE LICET \nMY Son, I charge thee, howsoever thou beest provoked \nthereunto, tell not the Truth to any Woman. For \nthis is that which is written: Cast not thy Pearls before \nSwine, lest they turn again and rend thee. Behold, in the \nNature of Woman is no Truth, nor Apprehension of Truth, \nnor Possibility of Truth; only, if thou entrust this Jewel \nunto them, they forthwith use it to thy Loss and Destruc-\ntion. But they are ware of thine own Love of Truth, and \nthy Respect thereunto; so therefore they tempt thee, flat-\ntering with their Lips, that thou betray thyself to them. And they feign falsely, with every Wile, and cast about \nfor thy Soul, until either in Love, or in Wrath, or in some \nother Folly thereof, thou speak Truth, profaning thy Sanc-\ntuary. So was it ever, and herein I call to my Witness \nSamson of Timnath, that was lost by this Error. Wow \nfor any Woman any Lie sufficeth; and think not in thine \nExtremity that Truth is mighty, and shall prevail, as it \ndoth with any Man; for with a Woman her whole Craft \nand Device is to persuade thee of this, so that thou utter \nthe Secret of thy Soul, and become her Prey. But so \nlong as thou nourish her with her own Food of Falsity, \nthou art secure. 133 \nDE NATURA FEMINAE \nTHE Nature of Woman, o my Son, is as thou hast learn- \ned in Our most holy Qabalah; and She is the Cloth-\ning in Sex of Man, the Magical Image of his Will to Love. Therefore was it said by thine Uncle Wolfgang von Goe-\nthe: Das Ewigweibliche zieht uns hinan. But therefore \nalso hath she no Nature of Truth, because she is but the \nEidolon of an Excitement and of a Going of thy Star, and \nappertaineth not unto its Essence and Stability. So then \nto thee she is but Matter, and to her thou art but Ener-\ngy; and neither is competent to the Formula of the other. Therefore also as thy Will is itself Imperfection, as I have \nshewed thee aforetime, thou art not in the Way of Love \nexcept thou be drest in that Robe of thine which thou \ncallest Woman. And thou canst not lure her to this Action \nproper to her by thy Truth; but thou shalt, as our Gram-\nmar sayeth, assume the Mask of the Spirit, that thou \nmayst evoke it by Sympathy. But thou shalt appear in \nthy Glory only when she is in thy Power, and bewildered \nutterly by Ecstasy. This is a Mystery, o my Son, and of \nold Time it was declared in the Fable of Scylla and \nCharybdis, which are the Formula of the Rock and of the \nWhirlpool. Now then meditate thou strictly upon this most \nworthy and most adorable Arcanum, to thy Profit and \nEnlightenment. '134 \nDE DUOBUS PRAEMIIS VIAE \nLET it be a Treasure in thine Heart, o my Son, this \nMystery that I shall next unveil before thine Eyes, o \nEagle that thou art undazzled by the Brilliance of Light, \nthat soarest continually with virile Flight to thine August \nInheritance. Behold, the Beatific Vision is of two Orders, \nand in the Formula of the Rosie Cross it is of the Heart \nand is called Beauty; but in the Formula of the Silver \nStar (id est, of the Eye within the Triangle) it is of the \nMind, and is called Wonder. Otherwise spoken, the for-\nmer is of Art, a sensuous and creative Perception; but \nthe latter of Science, an intellectual and intelligible In-\nsight. Or again, in our Holy Qabalah, the one is of Ti-\nphareth, the other of Binah; and in pure Philosophy, this \nis a Contemplation of the Cosmos Causal and Dynamic, \nand that of its Effect in Static Presentation. Now this \nRapture of Art is a Virtue or Triumph of Love in his \nmost universal Comprehension, but the Ecstasy of Science \nis a continual Orgasm of Light; that is, of the Mind. Thou sayest: o my Father, how may I attain unto this \nFullness and Perfection? Art thou there, o my Son? It \nis well, and blessed be the Bed wherein thou wast be-\ngotten, and the Womb of thy sweet Mother, Hilarion my \nConcubine, holy and adulterous, the Scarlet Woman! Amen. 135 \nDE ECSTASIA SAMADHI, QUO MODO AB \nHISS DIFFERT \nCONFUSE not thou this Beatific Vision with the Tran- \nces called Samadhi; yet is Samadhi the Pylon of the \nTemple thereof For Samadhi is the Orgasm of the Coi-\ntion of the Unlike, and is commonly violent, even as \nthe Lightning cometh of the Discharge between two \nVehicles of extreme difference of Potential. But, as I \nshewed formerly concerning Love, how each such Dis-\ncharge bringeth either Component more nigh to Equilib-\nrium, so is it in this other Matter, and by Experience \nthou cornest constantly to Integration of Love (or what \nnot) within thyself, just as all Effort becometh harmo-\nnious and easy by Virtue of Practice. Rememberest thou \nthe first time that thou wast thrown into Water, thy \nFear and thy Struggles, and the Vehemence of thy Joy \nwhen first thou didst swim without Support? Then little \nby little all Violence dieth away, because thou art adjust-\ned to that Condition. Therefore the Fury of thine early \nVictory in these Arts Magical and Sciences is but the \nsign of thine own Baseness and Unworthiness, since the \nContrast or Differential is so overwhelming to thee; but, \nbecoming expert and Adept, thou art balanced in the \nGlory, and calm, even as tlje Stars. 136 \nDE ARTE AMORIS ET DELICIARTJM \nMYSTIC' \nTHE Path therefore unto this Beatific Vision of Beauty, \no my Son, is that Practice of Bhakti Yoga which is \nwritten in the Book called Eight Score and Fifteen, or \nAstarte, by this mine Hand when I was in Gaul the Be-\nloved, at Montigny that is hard by the Forest of the Blue \nFountain, with Agatha my Concubine, the very Soul of \nLove and of Musick, that had adventured herself from \nbeneath the Cross Austral that she might seek me, to \ninspire and comfort me; and this was my Reward from \nthe Masters, and Consolation in the Years of my Sorrow. But the Way that leadeth to the other Form of this Vision \nof Beatitude, to wit, Science, is Ghana Yoga or Raja \nYoga, of which I have written only here and there, as one \nwho should strew great Stones upon the Earth in Disorder, \nby Default of building them nobly into a Pyramid. And \nof this do I most heartily repent me, and ask of the God \nThoth that He may give me (albeit at the Eleventh Hour) \nVirtue and Wit, that I may compose a True Book upon \nthese Ways of Union. Thy first Step, therefore, o my \nSon, is to attain unto Samadhi, and to urge thyself per-\npetually to Repetition of thy Success therein. For it hath \nbeen said by Philosophers of old that Practice maketh \nPerfect, and that Manners, being the constant Habit of \nLife, maketh Man. 137 \nDE PRAEMIO SUMMO, VERA SAPIENTIA \nET BEATITUDINE PERFECTA \nNOW then presently shall it come to pass that, as by \nDint of each Experience that Component thereof \nwhich is within thee is attuned to it, a slight Effort shall \nsuffice to unite thee therewith, and this without Shock, \nso that thou art no longer thrown back from the Trance, \nas exhausted, but abidest therein, almost without Knowl-\nedge of thy State. So then at last this Samadhi shall \nbecome normal to thy common Consciousness, as it were \na Point of View. Thus all Things shall appear to thee \nvery continually as to one in his first Love, by the Vision \nof Beauty; and by the Vision of Science thou shalt marvel \nconstantly with Joy unfathomable at the Mystery of the \nLaws whereby the Universe is upheld. This is that which \nis written: flue Wisdom and Perfect Happiness. 0 my \nSon, it is in this Contemplation that one hath the Reward \nof the Path, it is by this that the Tribulations are rolled \naway as a Stone from thy Tomb, it is with this that thou \nart wholly freed from the Illusions of Distinction, being \nabsorbed into the Body of Our Lady Nuit. May She \ngrant to thee this Beatitude; yea, not to thee only, but \nto all that are. 138 \nDE INFERNO SERVORUM \nNOW o my Son, having understood the Heaven that is \nwithin thee, according to thy Will, learn this con-\ncerning the Hell of the Slaves of the Slave-Gods, that it \nis a true Place of Torment. For they, restricting them-\nselves, and being divided in Will, are indeed the Servants \nof Sin, and they suffer, because, not being united in Love \nwith the whole Universe, they perceive not Beauty, but \nUgliness and Deformity; and, not being united in Under-\nstanding thereof, conceive only of Darkness and Con-\nfusion, beholding Evil therein. Thus at last they come, \nas did the Manichaeans, to find, to their Terror, a Division \neven in the One, not that Division which we know for \nthe Craft of Love, but a Division of Hate. And this, \nmultiplying itself, Conflict upon Conflict, endeth in \nHotchpot, and in the Impotence and Envy of Choronzon, \nand in the Abominations of the Abyss. And of such the \nLords are the Black Brothers, who seek by their Sorceries \nto confirm themselves in Division. Yet in this even is \nno trim Evil, for Love conquereth All, and their Corrup-\ntion and Disintegration is also the Victory of BABALON. 139 \nRHAPSODIA DE DOMINA NOSTRA \nBLESSED be She, ay, blessed unto the Ages be Our \nLady BABALON, that plieth Her Scourge upon me, \neven upon me, TO MEPA OlIPION, to compel me to \nCreation and to Destruction, which are One, in Birth and \nin Death, being Love! Blessed be She, uniting the Egg \nwith the Serpent and restoring Man unto his Mother \nthe Earth! Blessed be She, that offereth Beauty and \nEcstasy in the Orgasm of every Change, and that exciteth \nthy Wonder and thy Worship by the Contemplation of \nHer Mind many-wiled! Blessed be She, that hath filled \nHer cup with every Drop of my Blood, so that my Life \nis lost wholly in the Wine of Her Rapture! Behold, how \nShe is drunken thereon, and staggereth about the \nHeavens, wallowing in Joy, crying aloud the Song of \nuttermost Love! Is not She thy true Mother among the \nStars, o my Son, and hast not thou embraced Her in the \nMadness of Incest and of Adultery? Yea, blessed be She, \nblessed be Her Name, and the Name of Her Name, unto \nthe Ages! 140 \nRHAPSODIA DE ASTRO SUO \nomy Son, knowest thou not the Joy to lie in the Wilder- \nness and to behold the Stars, in their Majesty of Mo-\ntion calm and irresistible? Hast thou thought there that \nthou also art a Star, free because consciously in Accord \nwith the Law and Determination of thy Being? It was \nthine own True Will that bound thee in thine Orbit; \ntherefore thou speedest on thy Path from Glory unto \nGlory in continual Joy. 0 Son, o Reward of my Work, \no Harmony and Completion of my Nature, o Token of \nmy Toil, o Witness of my Love for thy sweet Mother, \nthe holy and adulterous Hilarion my Concubine, adorable \nin thine Innocence as she in her Perfection, is not this \nverily Intoxication of the Spirit in the Innermost, to be \nfree absolutely and eternally, to run and to return upon \nthe Course in the Play of Love, to fulfil Nature constantly \nin Light and Life? \"Afloat in the Aether, 0 my God, my \nGod!\" Without Support, without Constraint, wing thine \nown Way, o Swan, o Bliss of Brightness! 141 \nDE HARMONIA VOLUNTATIS ET \nPARCARUM \nTHIS is the evident and final Solvent of the Knot Philo- \nsophical concerning Fate and Freewill, that it is thine \nown Self, omniscient and omnipotent, sublime in Eter-\nnity, that first didst order the Course of thine own Orbit, \nso that that which befalleth thee by Fate is indeed the \nnecessary Effect of thine own Will. These two, then, \nthat like Gladiators have made War in Philosophy \nthrough these many Centuries, are made One by the Love \nunder Will which is the Law of Thelema. 0 my Son, \nthere is no Doubt that resolveth not in Certainty and \nRapture at the Touch of the Wand of our Law, an thou \napply it with Wit. Do thou grow constantly in the Assi-\nmilation of the Law, and thou shalt be made perfect. Behold, there is a Pageant of Triumph as each Star, free \nfrom Confusion, sweepeth free in his right Orbit; all \nHeaven acclaimeth thee as thou goest, transcendental in \nJoy and in Splendour; and thy Light is as a Beacon to \nthem that wander afar, strayed in the Night. Amoun. 142 \nPARENTHESIS DE QUADAM VIRGINE \nNOW o my Son, I will declare unto thee the Virtue \nof that Part of Love which receiveth and draweth, \nbeing the Counterpart of thine own. For behold! I am \nmoved in myself by the Absence of the Virgin that is \nappointed for me. And Her Eagerness of Purity doth \nencompass me with its soft Tenderness, and twineth about \nme with sweet Scent, so that my Mind is enkindled \nwith a gentle Flame, luminous and subtle, and I write \nunto thee as in Dream. For in this Enchantment of Her \nDevotion I am caught up cunningly into Beatitude, with \ngreat Joy of the Gods that have bestrewn my Way with \nFlowers, ay, many Flowers and Herbs of Magick and of \nHoliness withal to match their Beauty. Nay, o my Son, \nI will cease from this mine Epistle unto thee for awhile, \nthat I may rest in the Pleasure of this Contemplation, \nfor it is a Solace ineffable, and Recreation like unto \nSleep among the Mountains. Yea, can I wish thee more \nthan this, that, coming to mine Age, thou mayst find a \nVirgin like unto this to draw thee with her Simplicity, \nand her embroidered Silence? 143 \nDE CONSTANTIA AMORIS, CORVO CANDID\u00b0 \nTHINK it not strange, my Son, that I, praising Adultery, \nshould praise also Constancy and Delight therein. For \nthis is to state ill thy Question. Herein is Truth, and \nWisdom concerning this Matter, that so long as Love \nbe not wholly satisfied, and equilibrated by entire Ful-\nfilment and Exchange, Constancy is a Point of thy Con-\ncentration, and Adultery a Division in thy Will. But when \nthou hast attained the Summit and Perfection in any \nWork, of what Worth is it to continue therein? Hast thou \ntwo Stomachs, as hath a Cow, to chew the Cud of a di-\ngested Love? Yet, o my Son, this Constancy is not of \nNecessity a Stagnation. Nay, behold the body of Our \nLady Nuit, therein are found certain twin Suns, that \nrevolve constantly about each other. So also it may be \nin Love, that two Souls, meeting, discover each in the \nother such Wealth and Richness of Light and Love, that \nM One Phase of Life (or Incarnation) or even in many, \nthey exhaust not that Treasure. Nor will I say that such \nare not in their Degree and Quality thrice fortunate. But to persist in Dullness, in Satiety, and in mutual Irri-\ntation and Abhorrence, is contrary to the Way of Nature. So therefore there is no Rule in any such Case, but the \nLaw shall give Light to every one that hath it in his Heart, \nand by that Wisdom let him govern himself. 144 \nDE MYSTERIO MALI \nMOREOVER, say not thou in thy Syllogism that, since \nna  every Change soever, be it the Creation of a Sym-\nphony or a Poem or the Putrefaction of a Carcass, is an \nAct of Love, and since we are to make no Difference be-\ntween any Thing and any other Thing, therefore all \nChanges are equal in Respect of our Praise. For though \nthis be a Right Conclusion in the Term of thy Compre-\nhension as a Master of the Temple, yet it is false in the \nEyes of him that hath not attained to Understanding. So therefore any Change (or Phenomenon) appeareth \nnoble or base to the imperfect Mind, according to its \nConsonance and Harmony with the Will that governeth \nthat Mind. Thus, if it be thy Will to delight in Rhythm \nand (Economy of Words, the Advertisement of a Com-\nmodity may offend thee; but if thou art in need of that \nMerchandise, thou wilt rejoice therein. Praise then or \nblame aught, as seemeth good unto thee; but with this \nReflexion, that thy Judgment is relative to thine own \nCondition, and not absolute. This also is a Point of Toler-\nance, whereby thou shalt avoid indeed those Things that \nare hateful or noxious to thee, unless thou canst (in Our \nMode) win them by Love, by withdrawing thine Atten-\ntion from them; but thou shalt not destroy them, for \nthat they are without Doubt the Desire of another. 145 \nDE VIRTUTE TOLERANTIA \nUNDERSTAND then heartily, o my Son, that in the \nLight of this my Wisdom all Things are One, being \nof the Body of Our Lady Nuit, proper, necessary, and \nperfect. There is then none superfluous or harmful, and \nthere is none honourable or dishonourable more than an-\nother. Lot in thine own Body, the vile Intestine is of \nmore Worth to thee than the noble Hand or the proud \nEye, for thou canst lose these and live, but not that. Esteem therefore a Thing in Relation to thine own Will, \npreferring the Ear if thou love Musick, and the Palate \nif thou love Wine, but the essential Organs of Life above \nthese. Have Respect also to the Will of thy Fellow, not \nhindering him in his Way save as he may overly jostle \nthee in thine. For by the Practice of this Tolerance thou \nshalt come sooner to the Understanding of this Equality of \nall Things in Our Lady Nuit, and so to the high Attain-\nment of Universal Love. Yet in thy partial and par-\nticular Action, as thou art a Creature of Illusion, do \nthou maintain the right Relation of one Thing to another, \nfighting if thou be a Soldier, or building if thou be a \nMason. For if thou hold not fast this Discipline and \nProportion, which alloweth its true Will to every Part \nof thy Being, the Error of one shall draw all after it into \nRuin and Dispersion. 146 \nDE FORMULA DEORUM MORIENTILTM \nALAS, my Son! this hath been fatal constantly to many \na Man of noble Aspiration, that these Words were \nhidden from his Understanding. For there is a Balance \nin all Things, and the Body hath Charter to fulfil his \nNature, even as the Mind hath. So to repress one Func-\ntion is to destroy that Proportion which is wholesome, \nand wherein indeed all Health and Sanity have Consist-\nency. Verily, it is the Art of Life to develop each Organ \nof Body and Mind, or as I may say, Each Weapon of the \nWill to its Perfection, neither distorting any Use, nor \nsuffering the Will of one Part to tyrannize over that of \nanother. And this Doctrine (be it accursed!) that Pain \nand Repression are wholesome and profitable in them-\nselves is a Lie born of Sin and of Ignorance, the false \nVision of the Universe and of its Laws that is the Basis \nof the Averse Formula of the Slain God. It is true that \non Occasion one Limb must be sacrificed to save the whole \nBody, as when one cutteth away an Hand that is bitten \nby a Viper, or as when a Man giveth his Life to save \nhis City. But this is a right and natural Subordination \nof the superficial and particular to the fundamental and \ngeneral Will, and moreover it is a Case extraordinary, \nrelating to Accident or Extremity, not in any Wise a Rule \nof Life, or a Virtue in its Absolute Nature. 147 \nDE STULTIS MALIGNIS \nMY Son, there are Afflictions many and Woes many, \nthat come of the Errors of Men in Respect of the \nWill; but there is none greater than this, the Interference \nof the Busy-Body. For they make Pretence to know a \nMan's Thought better than he doth himself, and to direct \nhis Will with more Wisdom than he and to make Plans \nfor his Happiness. And of all these the worst is he that \nsacrificeth himself for the Weal of his Fellows. He that \nis so foolish as not to follow his own Will, how shall he \nbe so wise as to pursue that of another? If mine Horse \nbalk at a Fence, should some Varlet come behind him, \nand strike at his Hoofs? Nay, Son, pursue thy Path in \nPeace, that thy Brother beholding thee may take Cour-\nage from thy Bearing, and Comfort from his Confidence \nthat thou wilt not hinder him by thy Superfluity of Com-\npassion. Let me not begin to tell thee of the Mischiefs \nthat I have seen, whose Root was in Kindness, whose \nFlower was in Self-Sacrifice, and whose Fruit in Catas-\ntrophe. Verily, I think there should be no End thereof. Strike, rob, slay thy Neighbour, but comfort him not un-\nless he ask it of thee; and if he ask it, be wary. 148 \nAPOLOGIA PRO SUM LITERIS \nHOW then, sayst thou, concerning this my Counsel unto \nthee? I say Sooth, it is of my Will to bring up this \nmy Wisdom from its Silence into my conscious Mind, \nthat I may the more easily reflect thereon. Thou art but \na Pretext for my Action, and a Focus for my Light. Nevertheless, heed these my Words, for they shall profit \nthee, thou being of Age responsible in Judgment, and free \nin the Law of Thelema. Thus thou mayst read or no, con-\ncur or no, as thou wilt. Have I not tutored thee in the Way \nof the Balance, or of Antithesis, shewing thee the Art of \nContradiction, whereby thou dost accept no Word save as \nthe Victor in thy Mind over its Opposite, nay more, as the \nChild Transcendental of a Marriage of Opposites? This \nBook then shall serve thee but as a Food for thy Medita-\ntion, as a Wine to excite thy Mind to Love and War. It \nshall be unto thee as a Chariot to carry thee whither thou \nwilt; for I have seen in thee Independence and Sobriety \nof Judgment, with that Faculty (most rare, most noble!) to examine freely, neither obsequious nor rebellious to \nAuthority. 149 \nLAUS LEGIS THELEMA \nTHIS Property of thy Mind, my Son, is verily of su- \nblime Virtue; for the Vulgar are befogged, and their \nJudgment made null, by their emotional Reaction. They \nare swayed by the Eloquence of a Numscull or overpow-\nered by a Name, or an Office, or the Magic of a Tailor; \nelse, it may be they, being made Fools too often, reject \nwithout Reflexion even as at first they accepted. Again, \nthey are wont to believe the best or the worst, as Hope or \nFear predominateth in them at the moment. Thus, they \nlose Touch of the Blade of Reality, and it pierceth them. Then they in Delirium of their Wounds increase Delusion, \nfortifying themselves in Belief of those Phantasies created \nby their Emotions or impressed upon their Silliness, so \nthat their Minds have no Unity, or Stability, or Discrimi-\nnation, but become Hotchpot, and the ordure of Choron-\nzon. 0 my Son, against this the Law of Thelema is a Sure \nFortress, for through the Quest of thy True Will the Mind \nis balanced about it, and confirmeth its Flight, as the \nFeathers upon a Arrow, so that thou hast a Touchstone \nof Truth, Experience holding thee to Reality, and to \nProportion. Now therefore see from yet another Airt \nof Heaven the absolute Virtue of Our Law. 150 \nDE SPHINGE AEGYPTIORUM \nIT is now expedient that I instruct thee concerning the \nFour Powers of the Sphinx, the Strangler, and firstly, \nthat this most arcane of the Mysteries of Antiquity was \nnever at any Period the Tool of the slave-gods, but a \nWitness of Horus through the dark Aeon of Osiris to His \nLight and Truth, His Force and Fire. Thou canst by no \nmeans interpret the Sphinx in Terms of the Formula of \nthe Slain God. This did I comprehend even when as \nEliphaz Levi Zahed I walked up and down the Earth, \nseeking a Reconciliation of these Antagonists, which was \na Task impossible, for in that Plane they have Antipathy, \n(Even so may no Man form a Square Magical of Four \nUnits.) But the Light of the New Aeon revealeth this \nSphinx as the True Symbol of this our Holy Art of Magick \nunder the Law of Thelema. In Her is the Equal Develop-\nment and Disposition of the Forces of Nature, each in its \nBalanced Strength; also Her True Name is Soul of NU, \nhaving the Digamma for Phi, and endeth in Upsilon, not \nin Xi, so that her Orthography is 'TINT whose Numer-\nation is Six Hundred and Three Score and Six. But \ntherein is my Riddle of Riddles. For the Root thereof \nis SF, which signifieth the Incarnation of the Spirit; \nand of Kin are not only The Sun, Our Father, but \nSumer, where Man knew himself Man, and Soma, the \ndivine Potion that giveth Men Enlightenment, and Scin, \nLight Astral, and Scire also, by a far Travelling. But \nespecially is this Root hidden in Sus, that is of Sow, Swine, \nbecause the Most Holy must needs take its Delight under \nthe Omphalos of the Unclean. But this was hidden by \nWisdom, in order that the Arcanum should not be pro-\nfaned during the Aeon of the Slain God. But now it hath \nbeen given unto me to understand the Heart of Her \nMystery, wherefore, o my Son, by Right of the great Love \nthat I bear unto thee, I will inform thee thereof. 151 \nDE NATURA zFINt \nFIRSTLY, this Sphinx is a Symbol of the Coition of \ns  Our Lady BABALON with me THE BEAST in its \nWholeness. For as I am of the Lion and the Dragon, so \nis She of the Man and the Bull, in our Natures, but the \nConverse thereof in our Offices, as thou mayst under-\nstand by the Study of the Book of the Vision and The \nVoice. It is thus a Glyph of the Satisfaction and Perfec-\ntion of the Will and of the Work, the Completion of the \nTrue Man as the Reconciler of the Highest with the Low-\nest, so for our Convenience conventionally to distin-\nguish them. This then is the Adept, who doth Will \nwith solid Energy as the Bull, doth Dare with fierce \nCourage as the Lion, doth Know with swift Intelligence \nas the Man, and doth Keep Silence with soaring Sub-\ntlety as the Eagle or Dragon. Moreover, this Sphinx is \nan Eidolon of the Law, for the Bull is Life, the Lion is \nLight, the Man is Liberty, the Serpent is Love. Now \nthen this Sphinx, being perfect in true Balance, yet \ntaketh the Aspect of the Feminine Principle, that so she \nmay be Partner of the Pyramid, that is the Phallus, pure \nImage of Our Father the Sun, the Unity creative. The \nSignification of this Mystery is that the Adept must be \nwhole, Himself, containing all Things in true Proportion, \nbefore He maketh Himself Bride of the One Universe \nTranscendental, in its most Secret Virtue. And now \ntherefore, o my Son, comprehending this Mystery by \nthine Intelligence, I will write further unto thee of these \nFour Beasts or Powers. 152 \nDE TALMO \nCONCERNING the Bull, this is thy Will, constant and \nunwearied, whose letter is Vau, which is Six, the num-\nber of the Sun. He is therefore the Force and the Sub-\nstance of thy Being; but, besides this, he is the Hierophant \nin the Taro, as if this were said that thy Will leadeth \nthee unto the Shrine of Light. And in the Rites of Mith-\nras the Bull is slain, and his Blood poured upon the \nInitiate, to endow him with that Will and that Power of \nWork. Also in the Land of Hind is the Bull sacred to \nShiva, that is God among that Folk, and is unto them \nthe Destroyer of all Things. And this God is also the \nPhallus, for this Will operateth through Love, even as \nit is written in our Own Law. Yet again, Apis the Bull \nof Khem hath Khephra the Beetle upon His Tongue, \nwhich signifieth that it is by this Will, and by this Work, \nthat the Sun cometh unto Dawn from Midnight. All \nthese Symbols are most similar in their Nature, save as \nthe Slaves of the Slave-Gods have read their own For-\nmula into the Simplicity of Truth.\u2022 For there is Naught \nso plain that Ignorance and Malice may not confuse and \nmisinterpret it, even as the Bat is dazzled and bewildered \nby the Light of the Sun. See then that thou understand \nthis Bull in Terms of the Law of this our Aeon of Life. 153 \nDE LEONE \nOF the Lion, o my Son, be it said that this is the Courage \nof thy Manhood, leaping upon all Things, and seizing \nthem for thy Prey. His Letter is Teth, whose Implication \nis a Serpent, and the Number thereof Nine, whereof is \nAub, the Secret Fire of Obeah. Also Nine is of Jesod, \nuniting Change with Stability. But in the Book of Thoth \nHe is the Atu called Strength, or more truly, Lust, whose \nNumber is ELEVEN which is Aud, the Light Odic of \nMagick. And therein is figured the Lion, even THE \nBEAST, and Our Lady BABALON astride of Him, that \nwith her Thighs She may strangle Him. Here I would \nhave thee to mark well how these our Symbols are cog-\nnate, and flow forth the one into the other, because each \nSoul partaketh in proper Measure of the Mystery of Ho-\nliness, and is Kin with his Fellow. But now let me shew \nhow this Lion of Courage is more especially the Light in \nthee, as Leo is the House of the Sun that is the Father of \nLight. And it is thus: that thy Light, conscious of itself, \nis the Source and Instigator of thy Will, enforcing it to \nspring forth and conquer. Therefore also is his Nature \nstrong with Hardihood and Lust of Battle, else shouldst \nthou fear that which is unlike thee, and avoid it, so that \nthy Separateness should ivcrease upon thee. For this \nCause he that is defective in Courage becometh a Black \nBrother, and To Dare is the Crown of all thy Virtue, the \nRoot of the Tree of True Magick. 154 \nALTERA DE LEONE \nL\u00b01 in the First of thine Initiations, when First the \nHoodwink was uplifted from before thine Eyes, thou \nwast brought unto the Throne of Horus, the Lord of the \nLion, and by Him enheartened against Fear. Moreover, \nin Minutum Mundum, the Map of the Universe, it is the \nPath of the Lion that bindeth the two highest Faculties \nof thy Mind. Again, it is Mau, the Sun at Brightness of \nHigh Noon, that is called the Lion, very lordly, in \nour Holy Invocation. Sekhet our Lady is figured as a \nLioness, for that She is that Lust of Nuit toward Hadit \nwhich is the Fierceness of the Night of the Stars, and \ntheir Necessity; whence also is She true Symbol of thine \nown Hunger of Attainment, the Passion of thy Light to \ndare all for its Fulfilling. It is then the Possession of \nthis Quality which determineth thy Manhood; for without \nit thou art not impelled to Magick, and thy Will is but the \nSlave's Endurance and Patience under the Lash. For \nthis Cause, the Bull being of Osiris, was it necessary for \nthe Masters of the Aeons to incarnate me as (more espe-\ncially) a Lion, and my Word is first of all a Word of En-\nlightenment and of Emancipation of the Will, shewing to \nevery Man a Spring within Himself to determine His \nWill, that he may do that Will, and no more another's. Arise therefore, o my Son, arm thyself, haste to the \nBattle! 155 \nDE VMO \nLEARN now that this Lion is a natural Quality in Man, \nand secret, so that he is not ware thereof, except he \nbe Adept. Therefore is it necessary for thee also To \nKnow, by the Head of thy Sphinx. This then is thy \nLiberty, that the Impulse of the Lion should becomp \nconscious by Means of the Man; for without this thou art \nbut an Automaton. This Man moreover maketh thee to \nunderstand and to adjust thyself with thine Environment, \nelse, being devoid of Judgment, thou goest blindly upon \nan Headlong Path. For every Star in his Orbit holdeth \nnot his Way obstinately, but is sensitive to every other \nStar, and his true Nature is to do this. Oh, Son, how \nmany are they whom I have seen persisting in a fatal \nCourse, in Sway of the Belief that their dead Rigidity was \nExercise of Will! To Know: this is what teacheth thee \nhow best thou mayst accomplish thy Will. And the \nLetter of the Man is Tzaddi, whose Number is Ninety, \nwhich is Maim, the Water that conformeth itself perfectly \nwith its Vessel, that seeketh constantly its Level, that \npenetrateth and dissolveth Earth, that resisteth Pressure \nmaugre its Adaptability, that being heated is of Force \nto drive great Engines, and being frozen breaketh the \nMountains in Pieces. 0 my Son, seek well To Know \n156 \nDE DRACONE, QUAE EST AQTJILA, \nSERPENS, SCORPIO \nTHREEFOLD is the Nature of Love: Eagle, Serpent, \nand Scorpion. And of these the Scorpion is he \nthat, having no Lion of Light and of Courage within him, \nseemeth to himself encircled by Fire, and, driving his \nSting into himself, he dieth. Such are the Black Brothers, \nthat cry: I am I; they that deny Love, restricting it to \ntheir own Nature. But the Serpent is the Secret Nature \nof Man, that is Life and Death, and maketh his Way \nthrough the Generations in Silence. And the Eagle is \nthat Might of Love which is the Key of Magick, uplifting \nthe Body and its Appurtenance unto High Ecstasy upon \nhis Wings. It is by Virtue thereof that the Sphinx \nbeholdeth the Sun unwinking, and confronteth the Pyra-\nmid without Shame. Our Dragon, therefore, combining \nthe Natures of the Eagle and the Serpent, is our Love, the \nOrganon of our Will, by whose Virtue we perform the \nWork and Miracle of the One Substance, as saith thine \nAncestor Hermes Trismegistus, in his Tablet of Smar-\nagda. And this Dragon is called thy Silence, because in \nthe Hour of his Operation that within thee which saith \n\"I\" is abolished in its Conjunction with the Beloved. For \nthis Cause also is its Letter Nun, which in our Rota is \nthe Trump Death; and Nun hath the Value of Fifty, the \nNumber of the Gates of Understanding. 157 \nDE QUATTUOR VIRTUTIS FIN* \nSEE now our Sphinx, with what Subtility and Art it \nShe made Whole! Here is thy Light, the Lion, the \nNecessity of thy Nature, fortified by thy Life, the Bull, \nthe Power of Work, and guided by thy Liberty, the Man, \nthe Wit to adapt Action to Environment. These are three \nVirtues in One, necessary to all proper Motion, as I may \nsay in a Figure, the Lust of the Archer, the propulsive \nForce of his Arrri, and the equilibrating and directing \nControl of his Eye. Of these three if one fail, the Mark \nis not hit. But hold ! is not a fourth Element essential \nin the Work? Yea, soothly, all were vain without the \nEngine, Arrow and Bow. This Engine is thy Body, pos-\nsessed by thee and used by thee for thy Work, yet not \nPart of thee, even so as are his Weapons to this Archer \nin my Similitude. Thus is thy Dragon to be cherished \nof thy Lion, but if thou lack Energy and Endurance of \nthy Bull, thy Tools lie idle, and if Cunning and Intel-\nligence, with Experience also, of thy Man, thy Shaft flieth \ncrooked. So then, o my Son, do thou perfect thyself in \nthese Four Powers, and that with Equity. 158 \nDE LIBRA, IN QUA QUATTUOR VIRTUTES \nAEQUIPOLLENT \nBY Giiana Yoga cometh thy Man to Knowledge; by \nKarma Yoga thy Bull to Will; by Raja Yoga is thy \nLion brought to his Light; and to make perfect thy \nDragon, thou hast Bhakta Yoga for the Eagle therein, and \nHatha Yoga for the Serpent. Yet mark thou well how \nall these interfuse, so that thou m,ayst accomplish no one \nof the Works separately. As to make Gold thou must \nhave Gold (it is the Word of the Alchemists) so to become \nThe Sphinx thou must first be a Sphinx. For Naught \nmay grow save to the Norm of its own Nature, and in the \nLaw of its own Law, or it is but Artifice, and endureth \nnot. So therefore is it Folly, and a Rape wrought upon \nTruth, to aim at aught but the Fulfilment of thine own \ntrue Nature. Order then thy Workings in Accord with \nthy Knowledge of that Norm as best thou rnayst, not heed-\ning the Importunity of them that prate of the Ideal. For \nthis Rule, this Uniformity, is proper only to a Prison, and \na Man liveth by Elasticity, nor endureth Rigor save in \nDeath. But whoso groweth bodily by a Law foreign to \nhis own Nature, he hath a Cancer, and his whole (Econ-\nomy shall be destroyed by that small Disobedience. 159 \nDE PYRAMIDE \nNOW then at last art thou made ready to confront the \nPyramid, when thou art established as a Sphinx. For \nit hath also the four square Base of Law, and the Four \nTriangles of Light, Life, Love, and Liberty for its Sides, \nthat meet in a Point of Perfection that is Hadit, poised \nto the Kiss of Nuit. But in this Pyramid is no Differ-\nence of Form between the Sides, as it is in thy Sphinx, \nfor these are wholly One, save in Direction. Thou art \nthen an Harmony of the Four by Right of thine Attain-\nment of Adeptship, the Crown of thy Manhood, but not \nan Identity, as in Godhead. Therefore may it be said \nfrom one Point of Sight that thine Achievement is but a \nPreparation, an Adornment of the Bride for the Temple \nof Hymen, and his Rite. Verily, o my Son, I deem in \nmy Wisdom that this whole Work of Thy Development \nto Sphinx-hood cometh before the Work of Theurgy, for \nthe Lord descendeth not upon a Temple ill-conceived;and \nbuilded awry, nor abideth in a Shrine unworthy. Ac-\ncomplish then this Task in Patience, with Assiduity, not \nhasting furiously after Godliness. For this is most sure, \nthat to the Beauty of a Maiden answereth the Lust of her \nLord, spontaneous, and without Effort or Appeal of her \nContriving. 160 \nPROLEGOMENA DE SILENTIO \nBUT now concerning Silence, o my Son, I will have a \nfurther Word with thee. For thereby we mean not \nthe Muteness of him that hath a Dumb Devil. This Si-\nlence is the Dragon of thine Unconscious Nature, not only \nthe Ecstasy or Death of thine Ego in the Operation of its \nOrgan, but also, in its Unity with thy Lion, the Truth of \nthy Self. Thus is thy Silence the Way of the Tao, and \nall Speech a Deviation therefrom. This Lion and Dragon \nare therefore of thy Self, and the Man and the Bull the \nFeminine Counterparts thereof, being the Grace of Our \nLady BABALON that She bestoweth upon thee in thine \nAdultery with Her. They are then as a Vesture of Hon-\nour, and a Reward, that are won by the Intensity of thy \nLight and of thy Love. So properly we esteem Men by \nthe Measure of their Intelligence and of their Strength, \nsince they are equal in their essential Godhead, so far as \nconcerneth the Quiddity thereof. See thou closely more-\nover unto it, that if thou be well favoured of our Lady, \nthy Lion and thy Dragon grow in like Measure, for the \nExcess of the Feminine is Dead Weight. The Intellectual \nwithout Virility is a Dreamer of Follies, and the laborious \nGiant without Courage is a Slave. 161 \nDE NATURA SILENTII NOSTRI \nTHE Nature of this Silence is shewn also by the God \nHarpocrates, the Babe in the Lotus, who is also the \nSerpent and the Egg, that is, the Holy Ghost. This is the \nmost Secret of all Energies, the Seed of all Being, and \ntherefore must He be sealed up in an Ark from the Malice \nof the Devourers. If then by thine Art thou canst con-\nceal thy Self in thine own Nature, this is Silence, this, \nand not Nullity of Consciousness, else were a Stone more \nperfect in Adeptship than thou. But, abiding in thy \nSilence, thou art in a City of Refuge, and the Waters \nprevail not against the Lotus that enfoldeth thee. This \nArk or Lotus is then the Womb of Our Lady BABALON, \nwithout which thou wert the Prey of Nile and of the \nCrocodiles that are therein. Now, o my Son, mark thou \nwell this that I will write for thine Advertisement and \nBehoof, that this Silence, though it be Perfection of \nDelight, is but the Gestation of thy Lion, and in thy Sea-\nson thou must Dare, and come forth to the Battle. Else, \nwere not this Practice of Silence akin to the Formula of \nSeparateness of the Black Brothers? 162 \nDE FORMULA RECTA DRACONIS \nVERILY, o my Son, herein lieth the Danger and the \nTreason of thy Scorpion. For his Nature is against \nhimself, being the deepest Ego, that is, a Being separate \nfrom the Universe; and this is the Root of the Whole Mys-\ntery of Evil. For he hath in him the Magick Power, which \nif he use not, he is self-poisoned, even as any Organ of \nthe Body that refuseth its Function. So then his Cure \nis in his Ally the Lion, that feareth not the Crocodiles, \nnor hideth himself, but leapeth eagerly forward. The \nPath of the Mystick hath this Pitfall; that, though he \nunite himself with his God, his Mode is to withdraw \nfrom that which himseemeth is not God, whereby he \naffirmeth and confirmeth the Demon, that is, Duality. Be thou instant therefore, o my Son, to turn from every \nAct of Love at the Moment of full Satisfaction, flinging \nthe Invoked Might thereof against a new Opposite; for \nthe Formula of every Dragon is Perpetual Motion or \nChange, and therefore to dwell in the Satisfaction of thy \nNature is a Stagnation, and a Violation thereof, making \nthe Duality of Conflict, which is the Falling Away to \nChoronzon. Unto the which be Restriction in the Name \nof BABALON. 163 \nDE SUA CARTA COELORUM \nIpray thee to mark, o my Son, how the Grace of Nature \nwas benignant at my Nativity, to the Right Balance \nand Formulation of my Sphinx. For Neptune was in the \nSign of the Bull, giving Strength and Stability to my \nspiritual Essence. Uranus was ascending in the Lion, to \nfortify my Magical Will with Courage, and to turn it \nto the Salvation of Man. In the Waterman was Saturnus, \nto make mine Intelligence sober, profound, and capable \nof Labour. Jupiter, with Mercury His Herald, was in Scor-\npio, harmonizing me and my Word according to the Es-\nsence of my Nature. Then of the others, Mars was exalted \nin the Goat, for physical Endurance of Toil; Sol was \nconjoined with Venus in the Balance, for Judgment in Art \nand in Life, and for Equability of Temper. Lastly, the \nMoon was in the Sign of the Fishes, her loved Abode, for \na Gift of Sensitiveness and of Glamour. What then am I? I am a transient Effect of infinite Causes, a Child of \nChanges. There is no I, o thou that art not thou, else \nwere I segregated, a Stagnation, a Thing of Hate and of \nFear. But ever-moving, ever-changing, there is a Star in \nthe Body of our Lady Nuit, whose Word is None and \nTwo. 164 \nDE OPERE SUO \nIam not I. Then, sayst thou, why is this Word? Know, \no my Son, that this First Person is but a Common Fig-\nure of the Speech of Men, whereof the Magus may avail \nhimself without Implication of Metaphysick. Yet in the \nMystery of Illusion, which is the Instrument of the Uni-\nversal Will, I will not say the Harlot of Its Pleasure, are \nmanifested these many Stars, and amongst them that \nLogos of the Aeon of Horus whom thou callest TO MECA \nOHPION and thy Father. And this is by-come through \nVirtue of the Intensity of the Will to Change, through \nmany a Serpent-Phase of Life and Death, until in the \nPlay of the Game its Manifestation is the Utterance of \nthis Word of the Aeon, this Law of Thelema, that shall \nbe for a Season the Formula of the Magick of the Earth. Who then should inquire of the further Destiny of that \nStar, or of another? It is the Play of the Game, and the \nOperation of its Function shall suffice it. Rid thyself \ntherefore of this Thought of \"I\" apart from All, but, \nattaining to Consciousness of All by Our True Way, \ncontemplate the Play of Illusion by thine Instrument of \nMind and Sense, leaving it without Care to continue in its \nown Path of Change. 165 \nDE FRATRIBUS NIGRIS \no my Son, know this concerning the Black Brothers, \nthem that exult: I am I. This is Falsity and Delusion, \nfor the Law endureth not Exception. So then these Breth-\nren are not Apart, as they vainly think being wrought \nby Error; but are peculiar Combinations of Nature in \nHer Variety. Rejoice then even in the Contemplation of \nthese, for they are proper to Perfection, and Adornments \nof Beauty, like a Mole upon the Cheek of a Woman Shall \nI then say that were it of thine own Nature, even thine, \nto compose so sinister a Complex, thou shouldst not strive \ntherewith, destroying it by Love, but continue in that \nWay? I deny not this hastily, nor affirm; nay, shall I \neven utter any Hint of that which I may foresee? For \nit is in mine own Nature to think that in this Matter the \nSum of Wisdom is Silence. But this I say, and that boldly, \nthat thou shalt not look upon this Horror with Fear, or \nwith Hate, but accept this as thou dost all else, as a Phe-\nnomenon of Change, that is, of Love. For in a swift \nStream thou mayst behold a Twig held steady for awhile \nby the Play of the Water, and by this Analogue thou \nmayst understand the Nature of this Mystery of the Path \nof Perfection. 166 \nDE ARTE ALCHEMISTICA \nWILT thou acquaint thyself now further at my Reproof \nconcerning this Arcanum of Alchymia, the Art Egyp-\ntian, how to make Gold? Of a Surety this is already in \nthy Knowledge, if thou examine by Our Holy Qabalah, \nwhat be the Forces that are the Influx upon Tiphareth, \nwhich is the Harmony and Beauty, or Sol, in every King-\ndom of the Universe, so then also among Metals. Now \nthis Influx is Fivefold. First, from the Crown descendeth \nthe High Priestess in the Path of the Moon, for Inspi-\nration, and Imagination, and Idea; see to it that this Virgin \nbe Pure, for herein Error is Illusion. Next, from the \nFather floweth the Virtue of the Star in the Path of the \nWater-bearer, for Initiative, and Energy, and Determi-\nnation, in the Innermost. Third, from the Mother are \nthe Lovers in the Path of the Twins, for Intellectual \nWholeness, and for Adjustment to Environment. These \nThree are from the Supernals, and complete the Theorick \nof thy Work. After this, in the Praxis and Executive \nthereof thou hast the Hermit as an Influence from the \nSphere of Jupiter in the Path of the Virgin, for Secrecy, \nand for Concentration, and for Prudence. Lastly, from \nthe Sphere of Mars, travelleth Justice in the Path of the \nBalance, for Good Judgment, and Tact, and Art. 0 my \nSon, in this Chapter is more Wisdom than in Ten Thou-\nsand Folios of the Alchemists! Study therefore to acquire \nSkill in this Method, and Experience; for this Gold is not \nonly of the Metals, but of every Sphere, and this Key \nis of Virtue to enter every Palace of Perfection. 167 \nDE FEMINA: QUAE EST PROPRIA JOCO \nomy Son, hear this Wisdom of Experience, how at thy \nfirst Sight, when I put thee into the Arms of Ahitha \nthy sweet Stepmother my Concubine, such was thy Beau-\nty that she became enamoured of thee, crying aloud: Ay \nme, an such be the Fruit of thy Magick, o my Master, \nthen let me, me also, even me, give myself utterly to this \nHoly Art! Then did I, becoming heavy in Spirit, make \nQuestion of her, saying: To what End? and at this was \nshe confounded and brought into Bewilderment; but after \na great While, fumbling in her Ort of Mind, made An-\nswer, like a Scarecrow in a Field, so was it for Rags \nand Tatters of Thought. Thus yet more Atrabilious and \nSluggard was this Liver of thy Father, so that I fell into \na Gloom nigh unto Weeping. Then she beholding me with \nAmazement cried upon me thus: Art thou not glad in \nHeart, o my Master? At this I gave a Sigh, even as one \nnigh unto Death. And She: if this be so, then is no Need \nany more for me to give myself to Magick. Thereat, per-\nceiving yet again the Jest Universal of Our Lord Pan, \nwas I swallowed up (like unto Jonah of Old Fable) in \nthe Belly of the Whale called Laughter, and it seemeth \nto me at this present Writing that I am like to abide \ntherein for the Time that remaineth to me in this Body. 168 \nDE FORMULA FEMINAE \nNOW this is the right Power and Property of a Woman, \nto arrange and to adjust all Things that exist in their \nproper Spheie, but not to create or to transcend. There-\nfore in all practical Matters is She of Might and of Wit \nto produce an Effect consonant with her Mood. And her \nSymbol is Water, that seeketh the Level, whether for \nWrath, eating away the Mountains (yet even in this mak-\ning smooth the Plains) or for Love, in Fecundity of Earth. But it is Fire of Man that hath heaved up those Moun-\ntains, in huge Turmoil. Man then maketh Mischief and \nTrouble by his Violence, be his Will convenient to his \nEnvironment, or antipathetic; but Woman disturbeth by \nManipulation, adroit or sinister as her Mood may be of \nOrder or of Disorder. For any Man to meddle in Her Affair \nis Folly, for he comprehendeth not Quiet; so also for her \nto emulate him in his Office is Fatuity. Therefore in Mag-\nick though a Woman excel all Men in every Quality \nthat is profitable to her for Attainment, yet she is Naught \nin that Work, even as a Man without Hands in the Shop \nof a Carpenter; for she hath not the Organism that might \nflake Use of this Opportunity. Of all this is she aware \nby her Instinct, for her Nature is to Understand, even \nwithout Knowledge; and if thou doubt herein the Wisdom \nof thy Sire, do thou seek out a Woman (but with Pre-\ncaution) and affirm these my Words. So shall she wax \nwoundily wrath, and look griesly upon thee, proclaim-\ning in shrill Voice her manifold Excellences, which she \nhath, and concern this Matter not one Whit. "

    "content": "DE FEMINA \nOF a Thousand Years it is nigh unto the Fiftieth Part, \no my Son, since I obtained Favour in the Sight of a \ngreat Master of Truth, whom Men called Allan Bennett, \nso that he received me for his Discipulus in Magick. And \nhe was instant with me in this Matter, and vehement, \nadjuring his Gods that this (which I have myself here \nabove declared unto thee) was the Truth concerning the \nNature of Woman. But I being but a Youth, and head-\nstrong, and being enraptured in Love of Women, and \nAdmiration of them, and Worship, delighting in them \neagerly, and learning constantly from them, nourished \nby the Milk of their Mystery, as it should be for all True \nMen, did resist angrily the Doctrine of that Most Holy \nMan of God. And because (as it was written) he was a \nVowed Virgin from his Birth, and had no Commerce with \nany in the Way of Carnality, I disabled his Judgment \nherein, as if he, being a Fish, had disallowed the Flight \nof Birds. But I, o my Son, am not wholly ignorant of \nWomen, save as all Men must be in the Limitation of \ntheir Nature, for the Number of my Concubines is not \nnotably or shamefully exceeded by that of the Phases of \nthe Moon since my Birth. Many also have been mw  Dis-\nciples in Magick that were Women, and (more also) I do \nowe, acknowledging the same with open Gladness, the \nGreater Part of mine own Initiation and Advancement \nto the Operation of Women. Notwithstanding all these \nThings, I bow humbly before Allan Bennett, and repent \nmine Insolence, for his Saying was Sooth. 170 \nDE VIA PROPRIA FEMINIS \nIT is indeed easy for a Woman to obtain the Experiences \nof Magick, in a certain Sort, as Visions, Trances, and \nthe Like; yet they take not Hold upon her, to transform \nher, as with Men, but pass only as Images upon a Spec-\nulum. So then a Woman advanceth never in Magick, \nbut remaineth the same, rightly or wrongly ordered \naccording to the Force that moveth Her. Here therefore \nis the Limit of her Aspiration in Magick, to abide joyous \nand obedient beneath the Man that her instinct shall \ndivine, so that, becoming by Habit a Temple well-order-\ned, comely and consecrated, she may in her next Incar-\nnation attract by her Fitness a Man-Soul. For this Cause \nhath Man esteemed Constancy and Patience as Qualities \npre-eminent in Good Women, because by these she \ngaineth her Going toward Our Godliness, Her Ordeal \ntherefore is principally to resist Moods, which make Dis-\norder, that is of Choronzon. Unto the which be Restric-\ntion in the Name of BABALON. Also, let her be content \nin this Way, for verily she hath a noble and an excellent \nPortion in Our Holy Banquet, and escapeth many a Peril \nthat is proper to us others. Only, be she in Awe and \nWariness, for in her is no principle of Resistance to Cho-\nronzon, so that if she become disordered in her Moods, \nas by Lust, or by Drunkenness, or by Idleness, she hath \nno Standard whereunto she may rally her Forces. In \nthis see thou her need of a well-guarded Life, and of a \nTrue Man for her God. 171 \nDE HAC RE ALTERA INTELLIGENDA \nMARK then, o my Son, how in the Antient Books of \nMagick it is Man that selleth his Soul unto the Devil, \nbut Woman that maketh Pact with him. For she hath \nconstantly the Wit and Power to arrange Things at his \nBidding, and she payeth this price of his Alliance. But \na Man hath one Jewel, and, bartering this, he becometh \nthe Mockery of Satanas. Let then this tutor thee in thine \nown Art of Magick, that thou employ Women in all Prac-\ntical Matters, to order them with Cunning, but Men in \nthy Need of Transfiguration or Transmutation. In a Trope, \nlet the Woman direct the Chess-Play of Life, but the \nMan alter the Rules, if he so will. Lo! in ill Play is Mis-\nchief and Disorder, but in a New Law is Earthquake, \nand Destruction of the Root of Things . Therefore is Fear \nof any Man that is in Commerce with his Genius, for \nnone knoweth if his Law shall amend the Game or do \nit Hurt; and of this the Proof is in Experience, won after \nthe Victory of his Will, when there is no Way of Return; \neven thus saith the Poet, Vestigia Nulla Retrorsum . Nor \ndo thou fear to create: for even as I have written in the \nBook of Lies (falsely so-called), thou canst create nothing \nthat is not God. But beware of false Creations wrought \nby Women in whom is no Function thereof, for they are \nPhantoms, poisonous Vapours, bred of the Moon in her \nWitchcraft of Blood. 172 \nDE CLAVIBUS MORTIS ET DIABOLI, ARCANIS \nTAROT FRATERNITATIS R.C. TT shall profit thee much, o my Son, or I err, that I \ninstruct thee in the Mystery of the Paths of Nun and \nof Ayin, that in our Rota are figured in the Atu called \nDeath, and in that called The Devil. Of these Nun joineth \nthe Sun with Venus, and is referred to Scorpio in the \nZodiac. This Path is perilous, for it seeketh the Level, \nand may abase thee, except thou take Heed unto the \nGoing. Of its three Modes, the Scorpion destroyeth him-\nself, as if it were a Type of Animal Pleasure. Next, the \nSerpent is proper to Works of Change, or Magick; yet \nis he poisonous also unless thou hast Wit to enchant him. Lastly, the Eagle is subtlest in this Sort, so that this \nPath is proper to a Transcendental Labour. Yet are all \nthese in the Way of Death, so that thy Wand is dissolved \nand corroded in the Waters of the Cup, and must be re-\nnewed by Virtue of thy Nature in Her Course. For Fire \nis extinguished by Water; but upon Earth it burneth \nfreely, and is inflamed by the Wind. Understand also that \nwhich is written concerning the Vesica, that it is the \nMother, giving Ease, Sleep, and Death, which Consola-\ntions are eschewed by the True Man or Hero. 173 \nSEQUITUR DE HIS VHS \nNOW the Path of Ayin is a Link between Mercury and \nthe Sun, and in the Zodiac importeth the Goat. This \nGoat is called also Strength, and standeth in the Merid-\nian at the Sunrise of Spring, and it is of his Nature to \nleap upon the Mountains. So therefore is he a Symbol \nof true Magick, and his Name is Baphomet, wherefore \ndid I design him as an Mu of Thoth, the Fifteenth, and \nput his Image in the Front of My Book The Ritual of \nHigh Magick, which was the Second Part of my Thesis \nfor the Grade of Major Adept, when I was clothed about \nwith the Body called Alphonse Louis Constant. Now \nthe Goat flieth not as doth the Eagle; but consider this \nalso, that it is the true Nature of Man to dwell upon the \nEarth, so that his Flights are oft but Phantasy; yea, the \nEagle also is bound to his Eyrie, nor feedeth upon Air. Therefore this Goat, making each Leap with Fervour, \nyet at all Times secure in his own Element, is a true \nHieroglyph of the Magician. Mark also, this Path sheweth \nOne continuous in Exaltation upon a Throne, and so is \nit the Formula of the Man, as the other was of the \nWoman. 174 \nDE OCULO HOOR \nsay furthermore that this Path is of the Circle, and of \nthe Eye of Horus that sleepeth not, but is vigilant. The \nCircle is all-perfect, equal every Way; but the Vesica \nhath bitter Need, and seeketh thy Medicine, that is of \nRight compounded for High Purpose, to ease her Infir-\nmity. Thus is thy Will frustrated, and thy Mind dis-\ntracted, and thy Work lamed, if indeed it be not brought \nto Naught. Also, thy Puissance in thine Art is minished, \nby a full Moiety, as I do esteem it. But the Eye of Horus \nhath no Need, and is free in his Will, not seeking a Level, \nnot requiring a Medicine, and is fit and worthy to be \nthe Companion and the Ally of thee in thy Work, as a \nFriend to thee, not Mistress and not Slave, that seek \never with Slyness and Deceit to encompass their own \nEnds There is moreover a Reason in Physics for my \nWord; study thou this Matter in the Laws of the Changes \nof Nature. For Things Unlike do in their Marriage \nproduce a Child which is relatively Stable, and resisteth \nChange; but Things Like increase mutually the Potential \nof their Particular Natures. Howbeit, each Path hath his \nown Use; and thou being instructed in all Ways, choose \nthine with Discretion. 175 \nDE SUA INMATIONE \nMY Son, my Delight, Honey of the Comb of my Life, \nI will say also this concerning the Odds of the For-\nmule of Male and Female, that mine Initiation was or-\ndered as followeth. First, unto the Middle of the Way, \nthe Attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of \nthe Holy Guardian Angel, were these Men appointed to \nmine Aid, Jerome Pollitt of Kendal, Cecil Jones of Bas-\ningstoke, Allan Bennett of the Border, and Oscar Ecken-\nstein of the Mountain, with no Woman. But after that \nAttainment hath Word come to me only through Women, \nOuarda the Seer, and Virakam, and in mine Initiation \ninto the Degree of Magus these, the Cat IAAPIUN thy \nMother, Helen the Play-Actress the Serpent, with Myr-\niamne the Drunkard and Rita the Harlot to bear Dagger \nand Poison; then these others Alice the Singing Woman \nfor a Monkey, and Gerda the Madwoman for an Owl; \nthen Catherine the Dog of Anubis, and Ahitha the Camel \nthat renewed the Work of Virakam, with Olun the Drag-\non and \u2014 but here do I restrict myself in Speech, for \nthe End is wrapped about with a Veil, as it were, the \nFace of a Virgin. But do thou meditate strictly upon these \nThings, distinguishing the right Property, Order, and Use \nof the one and the other in the Relative, even as thou \nmakest them All-One, that is None, in the Absolute. 176 \nDE HERBO SANCTISSIMO ARABICO \nRECALL, o my Son, the Fable of the Hebrews, which \nthey brought from the City Babylon, how Nebuchad-\nnezzar the Great King, being afflicted in his Spirit, \ndid depart from among Men for Seven Years' Space, \neating Grass as doth an Ox. Now this Ox is the Letter \nAleph, and is that Atu of Thoth whose Number is Zero, \nand whose Name is Maat, Truth, or Maut, the Vulture, \nthe All-Mother, being an Image of Our Lady Nuit, but \nalso it is called the Fool, who is Parsifal, 'der reine Thor,' \nand so referreth to him that walketh in the Way of the \nTao. Also, he is Harpocrates, the Child Horus, walking \n(as saith Daood, the Badawi that became King, in his \nPsalms), upon the Lion and the Dragon; that is, he is in \nUnity with his own Secret Nature, as I have shewn thee \nin my Word concerning the Sphinx. 0 my Son, yester \nEve came the Spirit upon me that I also should eat the \nGrass of the Arabians, and by Virtue of the Bewitch-\nment thereof behold that which might be appointed for \nthe Enlightenment of mine Eyes. Now then of this may \nI not speak, seeing that it involveth the Mystery of the \nTranscending of Time, so that in One Hour of our Terres-\ntrial Measure did I gather the Harvest of an Aeon, and \nin Ten Lives I could not declare it. 177 \nDE QUIBUSDAM MYSTERIIS, QUAE VIM \nyET even as a Man may set up a Memorial or Symbol \nto import Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand, so \nmay I strive to inform thine Understanding by Hiero-\nglyph. And here shall thine own Experience serve us, \nbecause a Token of Remembrance sufficeth him that is \nfamiliar with a Matter, which to him that knoweth it \nnot should not be made manifest, no, not in a Year of \nInstruction. Here first then is one amid the Uncounted \nWonders of that Vision: upon a Field blacker and richer \nthan Velvet was the Sun of all Being, alone. Then about \nHim were little Crosses, Greek, overrunning the Heaven. These changed from Form to Form geometrical, Marvel \ndevouring Marvel, a Thousand Times a Thousand in their \nCourse and Sequence, until by their Movement was the \nUniverse churned into the Quintessence of Light. More-\nover at another Time did I behold All Things as Bullae, \niridescent and luminous, self-shining in every Colour \nand every Combination of Colour, Myriad pursuing Myr-\niad until by their perpetual Beauty they exhausted the \nVirtue of my Mind to receive them, and whelmed it, so \nthat I was fain to withdraw myself from the Burden of \nthat Brilliance. Yet, o my Son, the Sum of all this \namounteth not to the Worth . of one Dawn-Glimmer of \nOur True Vision of Holiness. 178 \nDE QUODAM MODO MEDITATIONIS \nNOW for the Chief of that which was granted unto \nme, it was the Apprehension of those willed Changes \nor Transmutations of the Mind which lead into TY' uth, \nbeing as Ladders unto Heaven, or so I called them at \nthat Time, seeking for a Phrase to admonish the Scribe \nthat attended on my words, to grave a Balustre upon \nthe Stela of my Working. But I make Effort in vain, \n0 My Son, to record this Matter in Detail; for it is the \nQuality of this Grass to quicken the Operation of Thought \nit may be a Thousandfold, and moreover to figure each \nStep in Images complex and overpowering in Beauty, \nso that one hath not Time wherein to conceive, much \nless to utter, any Word for a Name of any one of them. Also, such was the Multiplicity of these Ladders, and \ntheir Equivalence, that the Memory holdeth no more \nany one of them, but only a certain Comprehension of \nthe Method, wordless by Reason of its Subtility. Now \ntherefore must I make by my Will a Concentration \nmighty and terrible of my Thought, that I may bring \nforth this Mystery in Expression. For this Method is of \nVirtue and Profit; by it mayst thou come easily and with \nDelight to the Perfection of Truth, it is no Odds from \nwhat Thought thou makest the first Leap in thy Medi-\ntation, so that thou mayst know how every Road endeth \nin Monsalvat, and the Temple of the Sangraal. 179 \nSEQUITUR DE HAC RE \nIbelieve generally, on Ground both of Theory and Expe- \nrience, so little as I have, that a Man must first be \nInitiate, and established in Our Law, before he may use \nthis Method. For in it is an Implication of our Secret En-\nlightenment, concerning the Universe, how its Nature \nis utterly Perfection. Now every Thought is a Separation, \nand the Medicine of that is to marry Each One with its \nContradiction, as I have shewed formerly in many Writ-\nings. And thou shalt clap the one to the other with Ve-\nhemence of Spirit, swiftly as Light itself, that the Ecstasy \nbe Spontaneous. So therefore it is expedient that thou \nhave travelled already in this Path of Antithesis, know-\ning perfectly the Answer to every Glyph or Problem, \nand thy Mind ready therewith. For by the Property of \nthis Grass all passeth with Speed incalculable of Wit, \nand an Hesitation should confound thee, breaking down \nthy Ladder and throwing back thy Mind to receive Im-\npression from Environment, as at thy first Beginning. Verily, the Nature of this Method is Solution, and the \nDestruction of every Complexity by Explosion of Ecstasy, \nas every Element thereof is fulfilled by its Correlative, \nand is annihilated (since it loseth Separate Existence) \nin the Orgasm that is consummated within the Bed of \nthy Mind. 180 \nSEQUITUR DE HAC RE \nTHOU knowest right well, o my Son, how a Thought \nis imperfect in two Dimensions, being separate from \nits Contradiction, but also constrained in its Scope, be-\ncause by that Contradiction we do not (commonly) com-\nplete the Universe, save only that of its Discourse. Thus \nif we contrast Health with Sickness, we include in their \nSphere of Union no more than one Quality that may be \npredicated of all Things. Furthermore, it is for the most \nPart not easy to find or to formulate the true Contra-\ndiction of any Thought as a positive Idea, but only as a \nFormal Negation in vague Terms, so that the ready An-\nswer is but Antithesis. Thus to \"White\" one putteth not \nthe Phrase \"All that which is not White,\" for this is void, \nformless; it is neither clear, simple, nor positive in \nConception; but one answereth \"Black,\" for this hath an \nImage of his Significance. So then the Cohesion of \nAntitheticals destroyeth them only in Part, and one \nbecometh instantly conscious of the Residue that is un-\nsatisfied or unbalanced, whose Eidolon leapeth in thy \nMind with Splendour and Joy unspeakable. Let not this \ndeceive thee, for its Existence proveth its Imperfection, \nand thou must call forth its Mate, and destroy them by \nLove, as with the former. This Method is continuous, \nand proceedeth ever from the Gross to the Fine, and from \nthe Particular to the General, dissolving all Things into \nthe One Substance of Light. 181 \nCONCLUSIO DE HAC MODO SANCTITATIS \nLEARN now that Impressions of Sense have Opposites \nreadily conceived, as long to short, or light to dark; \nand so with Emotions and Perceptions, as Love to Hate, \nor false to true; but the more Violent is the Antagonism, \nthe more is it bound in Illusion, determined by Relation. Thus the Word 'Long' hath no Meaning save it be refer-\nred to a Standard; but Love is not thus obscure, because \nHate is its twin, partaking bountifully of a Common Na-\nture therewith. Now, hear this : it was given unto me \nin my Visions of the Aethyrs, when I was in the Wild-\nerness of Sahara, by Tolga, upon the Brink of the Great \nEastern Erg, that above the Abyss Contradiction is Unity, \nand that nothing could be true save by Virtue of the Con-\ntradiction that is contained in itself. Behold therefore, \nin this Method thou shalt come presently to Ideas of this \nOrder, that include in themselves their own Contradic-\ntion, and have no Antithesis. Here then is thy Lever of \nAntinomy broken in thine Hand; yet, being in true Bal-\nance, thou mayst soar, passionate and eager, from Heaven \nto Heaven, by the Expansion of thine Idea, and its Exal-\ntation, or Concentration as thou understandest by thy \nStudies in the Book of the Law, the Word thereof con-\ncerning Our Lady Nuit, and Hadit, that is the Core of \nevery Star. And this last Going upon thy Ladder is \neasy if thou be truly Initiate, for the Momentum of thy \nForce in Transcendental Antithesis serveth to propel \nthee, and the Emancipation from the Fetters of Thought \nthat thou hast won in that Praxis of Art maketh the \nWhirlpool and Gravitation of Truth of Competence to \ndraw thee unto itself. 182 \nDE VIA SOLA SOLIS \nTHIS is the Profit of mine Intoxication of this holy \nHerb, The Grass of the Arab, that it hath shewed me \nthis Mystery (with many others) not as a New Light, for \nI had that aforetime, but by its swift Synthesis and Ma-\nnifestitation of a long Sequence of Events in a Moment, \nI had Wit to analyse this Method and to discover its Es-\nsential Law, which before had escaped the Focus of the \nLens of mine Understanding. Yea, o my Son, there is no \nTrue Path of Light, save that which I have formerly made \nplain ; yet in every Path is Profit, if thou be cunning to \nperceive it and to clasp it. For we win Truth oftentimes \nby Ref lexion, or by the Composition and Selection of an \nArtist in his Presentation thereof, when else we were \nblind thereunto lacking his Mode of Light. Yet were \nthat Art of none avail unless we had already the Root of \nthat Truth in our Nature, and a Bud ready to flower at \nthe Summoning of that Sun, In Witness, nor a Boy nor \na Stone hath Knowledge of the Sections of a Cone, and \ntheir Properties; but thou mayst teach these to the Boy \nby right Presentation, because he hath in his Nature those \nLaws of Mind that are consonant with our Art Mathe-\nmatical, and hath Need only of Fledging (I may say this) \nso that he apply them consciously to the Work, when all \nbeing in Truth, that is, in the necessary Relations that \nrule our Illusion, he cometh in Course to Apprehension. 183 \nDE PRUDENTIA FRATERNITATIS A A \nHERE then, o My Son, that shall be mightier than all the \nKings of the Earth, as it is prophesied\u2014an thou be \nHe!\u2014because thou shalt establish the Law which I have \ngiven, even the Law of Thelema, here in this which I \nhave written is a Point of Judgment in thy Work to bring \ninto the Light of Initiation such as come unto thee, affirm-\ning their Will to this Attainment. For every One hath \nhis own Path and his own Law, and there is no Art in \nMagick but to seek out that Path, and that Law, that he \nmay pursue the one by the Right Use of the other. It shall \nbe that one cometh unto thee, desiring Amen-Ra (I speak \nin a Figure or Exemplar), another Asi, a third Hoor-Pa-\nKraat ; or again, one seeketh Instruction in Obeah, and \nhis Fellow in Wanga ; and of all these not one in Ten \nThousand shall be aware of his True Way. For albeit \nour Last Step is One for all, yet his Next Step is partic-\nular to each. Therefore is the Preparation of a Student \nthat seeketh Our Holy Order of A .\u2022. A most general, \ninforming his Mind of all known Methods, so that his \nWill may select among these by Instinct; then after, as \na Probationer he practiseth those which he hath prefer-\nred, and by the Examination of his Record after the \nPeriod appointed thou mayst have Wisdom concerning \nhim, to confirm him in those Ways which are thereby \nshewed to be germane to his True Nature. 184 \nALTERA DE SUA VIA \nTHUS I was brought into the Knowledge of myself in a \ncertain Secret Grace, and as a Poet, by Jerome Pollitt \nof Kendal; Oscar Eckenstein of the Mountain discovered \nManhood in me, teaching me to endure Hardship, and to \ndare many Shapes of Death; also he nurtured me in \nConcentration, the Art of the Mystics, but in Science \nwithout Lumber of Theology. Allan Bennett bestowed \nupon me the right Art of Magick, and our Holy Qabalah, \nwith a great Treasure of Learning in many Matters, but \nespecially concerning Egypt, and Asia, the Mysteries of \ntheir Arcane Wisdom. But of Cecil Jones had I the \nGreat Gift of the Holy Magick of Abramelin, and he in-\nducted me into that Order which we name not, because \nof the Silliness of the Profane that pretend thereto, and \nhe brought me to the Knowledge and Conversation of the \nHoly Guardian Angel; also, he was the Herald of the \nMasters of the Temple, when They bade me Welcome to \ntheir Order, appointing a Siege for me in the City of the \nPyramids, under the Night of Pan ; but for Three Years I \nwas not willing to avail myself thereof. Now mark well \nthis, o my Son, that this Path was peculiar to the Law of \nmy Star, and none other should follow me herein, or seek \nto follow me, for he hath his own proper Orbit. 0 my \nSon, err not by Generalization and Conformity, for this \nis of Very Idleness, and breedeth Ideals and Standards, \nthat are Death. 185 \nDE PRUDENTIA ARTIS DOCENDI \nNEVERTHELESS, this one Affliction shall touch nigh \nall that come to thee, and that is this Great Pox of \nSin, that is our Bane inherited of the Aeon of Slain Gods. Look then first of all, when any Postulant boweth before \nthee, whether there be not Conflict and Restriction in \nhis Mind, and in his Will. If he deem Good and Evil to \nbe absolute, instead of as relative to the Health of Ms \nBody, or the Weal of the Society of which he is a Member, \nor what not, as it may be, instruct him. Or, if he say \nthat he will sacrifice all for Initiation, correct him, as it is \nwritten: \"but whoso gives one particle of dust shall lose \nall in that hour.\" For it is Conflict if he weigh one Thing \nwith another; and Renunciation, being sorrowful, is not \nworthy of Acceptance. But he must with Joy unite all \nthat he is and hath, heaping the Whole into one Billow of \nLove, under Will. Yea, o my Son, until thou hast \nbrought the Postulant into our Freedom from Sin, and \nthe Sense and Conviction thereof, he is not ready for the \nPath of Our Magick and Illumination; because every \nWay cnever is a Going, and this Sin is an Obstacle and \na Fetter and an Hoodwink on every one of them, for it is \nRestriction, whether he set out by the Meditations of the \nDhamma, or by Our Qabalah, or by Vision, or Theurgy, \nor how else soever. 186 \nDE MENTE INIMICA ANIMO \nHOW shall a Man attain to the Trance where All is \nOne, if he yet debate within his Mind concerning \nVirtue as a Thing Absolute? Thus, o my Son, there be \nthose that are fuddled with Doubt whether Meat is to be \nEaten (I choose this as a Reference), which Habit is proper \nto the Lion, as Grass to the Horse, so that his right Prob-\nlem is solely this, what is fitting to his own Nature. Or \nagain, I suppose that he is in Vision, and an Angel, visit-\ning him, imparteth a Truth contrary to his Prejudice, as \nit fell out in mine own Case, when I inhabited the Body \nof Sir Edward Kelly, or so I do in Part remember, as it \nseemeth albeit dimly. This nevertheless is sure (or the \nlearned Casaubon, publishing the Record of that Word \nwith the Magician Dee, sayeth falsely) that an Angel did \ndeclare unto Kelly the Very Axiomata of Our Law of \nThelema, in good Measure, and plainly; but Dee, afflict-\ned by the Fixity of his Tenets that were of the slave-gods, \nwas wroth, and by his Authority prevailed upon the \nother, who was indeed not wholly perfected as an In-\nstrument, or the World ready for that Sowing. Consider \nalso how in this very Life I was the Enemy of my own \nLaw, and wrote down the Book of the Law contrary to \nmy conscious Will by the Virtue of Obedience as a Scribe, \nand strove constantly to escape mine own Work, and the \nUtterance of my Word, until by Initiation I was made \nAll-One. 187 \nDE ILLUMINATORUM OPERIBUS DIVERSIS \nnO thou then understand how few be they whose Work \nin this their present Lives is our Way of Initiation. Yet \nit is written in the Book of the Law that the Law is for \nall, so that thou shalt in no wise err if thou establish it as \nthe Formula of the Aeon, universal among Men. Also, \neven for them that are fitted to advance in our Light, \nthere is Order and Diversity in Function, as regardeth \ntheir Work in Our Sublime Brotherhood. Thus, it might \nwell be that, in a Profess-House of the Temple, or College \nof the Holy Ghost, each Knight or Brother might severally \nattain Experience of every Trance, unto the Perfection of \nall Illumination; yet by this there ought not Confusion \nto be confected, one usurping the appointed Office of \nanother. For the Abbot, although he be not enlightened \nwholly, is yet Abbot; and the Place of the Cook, were he \nSaint, Arhan, and Paramahamsa in one Person, is in his \nKitchen. Confound not thou in any wise therefore the \nDegree of Attainment of any Man with his right Function \nin Our Holy Order; for although by Initiation cometh \nthe Light, and the Right, and the Might to accomplish \nall Works soever, yet these are inoperative save as they \nare able to use a Machine which is of the same Order of \nThings as the Effect required. As the best Swordsman \nhath Need of a Sword, so hath eVery Magician of a Body \nand Mind capable to the Work that he willeth; and he \ncan do nothing, save it be proper to his Nature. 188 \nDE EADEM RE ALTERA VERBA \nBY this Understanding be they rebuked that make a Re- \nproach to our Art, saying in their Insolence that if we \nhave all Power, why are we betimes in Stress of Pover-\nty, and in Contempt of Men, and in Pain of Disease, and \nso forth, mocking us, and holding our Magick for Delu-\nsion. But they behold not our Light, how it guideth us \nin our Path unto a Goal that is not in their Comprehen-\nsion, so that we crave not that which seemeth to them \nthe sole Food and Comfort of Life. Also, this which we \nattain, though it be the Essence of Omniscience and Omni-\npotence, informeth and moveth the Material World (so \nto call it) only according to the Nature of that which is \ntherein. For the Light of the Sun (by His very Whole-\nness itself) sheweth a Rose red, but a Leaf green; and His \nHeat gathereth the Clouds, and disperseth them also. So \nI then, though I were perfect in Magick, might not work \nin Metals as a Smith, or become rich by Commerce as a \nMerchant; for I have not in my Nature the Engines prop-\ner to these Capacities, and therefore it is not of my Will \nto seek to exercise them. Here then is my Case, that I \ncan not because I will not; and it were Conflict, should \nI turn thither. But let every Man become perfect in his \nown Work, not heeding the Rebuke of another, that some \nWay not his own is more Noble, or Profitable, but being \nconstant in Mindfulness concerning his Business. 189 \nDE PACE PERFECTA LUCE \nHOW shall they measure our Stature and our Success \nby their Canon of Relation and Illusion, and their \nIgnorance of our Nature? Time is but Sequence, and a \nmoment of Light outweigheth an Age of Darkness. What \nis Happiness but an Issue of the Harmony of our Cons-\nciousness with our Truth, and the Conformity of Will \nwith Action? To the Initiate is Certainty of his Fulfil-\nment, which to the Profane is but the Effect of Hazard, \nand he feareth to lose what he loveth, or thinketh he \nloveth. But we, loving only in Light, suffer not by Fear \nor by Bereavement, because to us every Event is Wel-\ncome, being right, necessary and proper to our particular \nPath. The Knowledge of this One Matter is the End of \nDread and of Regret ; make thou it the Governor of thy \nMind, to rule its Pace, lest it hasten or lag by Stress of \nthine Environment. Now this Attainment is possible for \nall Mankind, since it asketh but Resolution of Complex-\nities that already exist; so that this True Wisdom and \nPerfect Happiness cometh by the Acceptance of our Law, \nand its Use is the Key to all Locked Doors of the Soul, the \nSolvent of every Knot of the Mind, and the Reconcile-\nment of every Contention. 0 my Son, in the Promulga-\ntion of the Law lieth the Reward of our Chief Work, the \nmaking whole of Mankind from that Conscience of Sin \nwhich divideth him, and afflicteth his Spirit. 190 \nDE PACE PERFECTA \noMY Son, is it not a Marvel, this Light whereof we are \nthe Quintessence and the Seed? By it are we made \nWhole, dissolved in the Body and in the Soul of Our \nLady Nuit even as Her Lord Hadit, so that the Gnostic \nSacrament of the Cosmos is perpetually Elevated before \nus. We behold all that is and comprehend its Mystery, \nand its Order in this High Mass eternally celebrated \namong us, acknowledging the Perfection of the Rite, \nneither confusing the Parts thereof, nor discriminating \nin Worship between them. So unto us is every Phenom-\nenon a Shew of Godliness, proceeding continually in a \nPageant that returneth unto itself, identical in the Phase \nof Naught as of Many, but whirling in the Orgia of Inef-\nfable Holiness as it were a Dance that weaveth Figures of \nBeauty in Variety inexhaustible. Shall the Initiate be-\nstir him, to better so prime a Perfection? Nay, this Will \nthat was his is accomplished ; he hath attained the Sum-\nmit; so without Hope or Fear he abideth, and leaveth \nhis Vehicle of Illusion and Magical Engine, that is, as \nMen say, his Body and Mind, to work out their Ritual of \nChange without his Interference. 0 my Son, ask not to \nwhat End! As it is written in the Book of the Heart Girt \nwith the Serpent, concerning the Boy and the Swan: Is \nthere not Joy ineffable in this aimless Winging? 191 \nDE MORTE \nTHOU hast made Question of me concerning Death, and \nthis is mine Opinion, of which I say not: This is the \nTruth. First in the Temple called Man is the God, his \nSoul, or Star, individual and eternal, but also inherent in \nthe Body of Our Lady Null. Now this Soul, as an Offi-\ncer in the High Mass of the Cosmos, taketh on the Vesture \nof his Office, that is, inhabiteth a Tabernacle of Musion, a \nBody and Mind. And this Tabernacle is subject to the \nLaw of Change, for it is complex, and diffuse, reacting to \nevery Stimulus or Impression. If then the Mind be at-\ntached constantly to the Body, Death hath not Power to \ndecompose it wholly, but a decaying Shell of the Dead \nMan, his Mind holding together for a little his Body of \nLight, haunteth the Earth, seeking (in its Error, that \nfeareth Change) a new Tabernacle in some other Body. These Shells are broken away utterly from the Star that \ndid enlighten them, and they are Vampires, obsessing \nthem that adventure themselves into the Astral World \nwithout Magical Protection, or invoke them, as do the \nSpiritists. For by Death is Man released only from the \nGross Body, at the first, and is complete otherwise upon \nthe Astral Plane, as he was in his Life. But this Whole-\nness suffereth Stress, and its Girders are loosened, the \nweaker first, and after that the stronger. "

    "content": "MSCHATOLOGIA \nCONSIDER now in this Light what shall come to the \nAdept, to him that hath aspired constantly and firmly \nto his Star, attuning the Mind unto the Musick of its Will. In him, if his Mind be knit perfectly together in itself, \nand conjoined with the Star, is so strong a Confection \nthat it breaketh away easily not only from the Gross \nBody, but the Fine. It is this Fine Body which bindeth \nit to the Astral, as did the Gross to the Material, World; \nso then it accomplisheth willingly, the Sacrament of a \nSecond Death, and leaveth the Body of Light. But the \nMind, cleaving closely by Right of its Harmony, and \nMight of its Love, to its Star, resisteth the Ministers of \nDisruption, for a Season, according to its Strength. Now, \nif this Star be of those that are bound by the Great Oath, \nincarnating without Remission because of Delight in the \nCosmic Sacrament, it seeketh a new Vehicle in the Ap-\npointed Way, and indwelleth the Foetus of a Child, and \nquickeneth it. And if at this Time the Mind of its Former \nTabernacle yet cling to it, then is there Continuity of \nCharacter, and it may be Memory, between the two \nVehicles. This, briefly and without Elaboration, is the \nWay of Asar in Amennti, according to mine Opinion, of \nwhich I say not: This is the Truth. 193 \nDE NUPTIIS SUMMIS \nNOW then to this Doctrine, o my Son, add thou that \nwhich thou hast learned in the Book of the Law, that \nDeath is the Dissolution in the Kiss of Our Lady Nuit. This is a true Consonance as of Bass with Treble; for \nhere is the Impulse that setteth us to Magick, the Pain of \nthe Conscious Mind. Having then Wit to find the Cause \nof this Pain in the Sense of Separation, and its Cessation \nby the Union of Love, it is the Summit of Our Holy Art \nto present the whole Being of Our Star to Our Lady \nin the Nuptial of our Bodily Death. We are then to \nmake our whole Engine the true and real Appurten-\nance of our Force, without Leak, or Friction, or any \nother Waste or Hindrance to its Action. Thou know-\nest well how an Horse, or even a Machine propelled by a \nMan's Feet, becometh as it were an Extension of the \nRider, through his Skill and Custom. Thus let thy Star \nhave Profit of thy Vehicle, assimilating it, and sustaining \nit, so that it be healed of its Separation, and this even in \nLife, but most especially in Death. Also thou oughtest \nto increase thy Vehicle in Mass by true Growth in Bal-\nance that thou be a Bridegroom comely and well-fa-\nvoured, a Man of Might, and a Warrior worthy of the \nBed of so divine a Dissolution. 194 \nDE ARTE VOLUPTATIS DILEMMA QUAEDAN1 \nTHERE is a named Objection, o my Son, to our Thesis \nconcerning Will that it should flow freely in its Way; \nvide licet, that for such as I am it is well, because I am \nendowed by Nature with a Lust insatiable in every Kind, \nSc. that the Universe itself seemeth incapable to appease \nit. For I have poured myself out unceasingly, in Bodily \nPassion, and in Battles with Men, and with Wild Beasts, \nand with Mountains and Deserts, and in Poetry and other \nWritings of the Musick of mine Imagination, and in Books \nof our Own Mysteries, and in Works Magical, and in Arts \nPlastic and so forth, so that in mine Age I am become \nverily a Slave to mine own Genius; and my Law is that \nunless I sleep or create, my Soul is sick, and fain to claim \nthe Reward and the Recreation of my Death. But (I hear \nthee say it) this is not the Case of All, or even of many, \nMen; but their Ort of Will is satisfied easily at its first \nGuerdon. Should not then their Wisdom be to resist \nthemselves for a Space, as Water heaped up by a Dam \ngathereth Force, and Hunger feedeth upon Abstinence? Also, there is that which I have written in a former \nChapter of the right Use of Discipline ; and thirdly, this \nFree Flowing is without Subtility of Art, as it were an \nHarlot that plucketh Men by the Sleeve. 195 \nDE HOC MODO DISSOLUTIO \nWEE therefore will I write down the Answer to this \nnIndictment of our Wisdom, that every Act of Will is \nto be made in its Perfection, which State is to be attained \naccording to these Conditions first, those of its own \nLaw; second, those of its Environment. Judge thine \nown Case individually, each as it pleadeth ; for there is \nno Canon or Code, since every Star hath its own Law \ndiverse from every other. Now there is the Restraint of \nConflict, which is Impotence and Disruption; but the \nRestraint of Discipline is a Fortification of the Will by \nRepose and by Preparation, as a Conqueror resteth his \nArmies, and feedeth them and looketh to their Furniture \nand to their Spirit, before he joineth the Battle. Also, \nthere is the Restraint of Art, which includeth that other \nof Discipline, and its Nature is to adorn the Will and to \nadmire its Strength and its Beauty, and to enjoy its Vic-\ntory by Anticipation in full Confidence, not fearful of \nTime that robbeth them that are ignorant concerning \nhim, how he is but Mirage and Illusion, incapable to be-\nsiege the Fortress of the Soul. Work thou thy Will, \nknowing (as I said aforetime by the Mouth of Eliphaz \nLevi Zahed), thyself Omnipotent, and thine Habitation \nEternity. 0 my Son, attend well this Word, for it is an \nHeirloom, and a Ring of Ruby and Emerald in thine In-\nheritance. 196 \nDE COMOEDIA QUAE ELAN DICITUR \nsUBTLER than the Serpent of Hermes, o my Son, is this \nWay of the Restraint of Art, and thou shalt meet \ntherein with the God Pan, and have him to thy Playmate. So shalt thou devise Comedy and Tragedy, as it were Set-\ntings for the Jewel of thy Will, to enhance the Beauty \nthereof, and to refine thy Pleasures. This is that which \nis written in the Book of the Law \u2022 \"Wisdom says: be \nstrong! Then canst thou bear more joy. Be not animal; \nrefine thy rapture! If thou drink, drink by the eight and \nninety rules of art; if thou love, exceed by delicacy; \nd if thou do aught joyous, let there be subtlety therein. But exceed! exceed!\" Thus thou mayst even toy with thy \ntamed Devil of Sin, and use the Pain thereof to sharpen \nthe Taste of thy Meat, being Adult, and thy Tongue keen \nto the Olive, and cloyed by the Sweet, while a Child is \nopposite to this in his Preference; or as a skilled Match \nof Love aboundeth in Pinchings, Slappings, Bitings and \nthe like, to intensify the Bout and to prolong it. But this \nis Risk and Peril, unless thou be wholly Master, One in \nthy Will; for there is Poison in these dead Snakes, to \ndestroy thee if thou lend them of thy Life by so little as \none Doubt of thyself, as a Seed of Division. 197 \nDE LUDO AMORIS \nIN this Mystery of the Restraint of Art is also the Secret \nof Illusion. Why, sayst thou, hath not our Lady Nuit \nher Will of Her Lord Hadit, and He of Her, and so all \nended? But this is the Play of Her Love, that She veileth \nHer Beauty in the Robe of Illusion many-coloured, and \nevadeth Him in Sport, yea, and divorceth Him from the \nEmbrace, weaving new Modesties and Allurements in \nHer Dance. Now, o my Son, the full Comprehension of \nthis Arcanum is the Fruit of Contemplation, if this be \nprepared by the Experience of this Art in thine own Case. But to them that understand not, and have Grief of Sepa-\nration, being deceived by this Play so that they deem it \nthe Division of Hate, She can but speak in Simplicity by \nthat Word written in the Book of the Law: \"To me !\" For until thou love, the Play of Love is but Emptiness; \nand its Cruelty is cruel indeed, except thou know it to be \nbut a Sauce to whet Appetite, and to give Emphasis of \nContrast, as a Painter limneth the Light by Cunning of \nhis Shadows. But all this Delight that thou mayst have \nof the Universe both in its Veils and in its Nakedness is \na Reward of thine Attainment of Truth, and followeth \nafter it. Nor canst thou comprehend this Doctrine by \nMind, for the Division in thee erieth aloud in its Agony, \ndenying it, unless thou be wholly Initiate. 198 \nDE GAUDIO STUPRI \nn MY Son, this Sin itself that is our Disease is but Mis- \nunderstanding of that Art of the Love of Our Lady \nNuit, Yea, verily, it is all a Trick of Her Wit, and a \nDevice of Her Delight, that Sin should appear, and also \n(mark thou well!) the Misapprehension of its Nature. Therefore the Pain of any Sinner in his Division and his \nSeparation is to Her a little Spasm of Pleasure. But as \nfor him, let him apprehend this Doctrine, and dissolve \nhimself in Her Love. Thou then, being Initiate and Illu-\nminated in this Truth, mayst accept thine own Sorrow, or \nrather that of thy Vehicle, as Lackey to the Joy that thou \nhast in thy True Self, the Star among the Stars of Her \n/Body. The Adept of this our Art is not compassionate \nconcerning Sin, in his own Vehicle or another's, unless \nthe Healing thereof be proper to his Will, for he is aware \nof the whole Truth of the Matter. So goeth he upon his \nWay, and tighteneth not a Rein upon the Stallions of the \nUniverse, but is content, beholding the Speed of their \nCourse. Verily, o my Son, it is well written in the Book \nof the Magus that it is the Curse of my Grade that I must \nneeds preach my Law unto Men. For I am afflicted in \nmy Tabernacle on this Count, but in my Self I rejoice, and \njoin in the Laughter of Her Love. 199 \nDE CAECITIA PHILOSOPHORUM \nANTIQUORUM \nBEHOLD, how comfortable is this my Wisdom, wherein \nI have resolved every Conflict soever that is or that \ncan be, even in all Dimensions, that Antagonism of Things \nno less than their Limitations. I have said: Evil, be \nthou my Good; for it is the Magical Mirror of our Astarte, \nand the Caduceus of our Hermes. Now this was the Er-\nror of Elder Philosophers, that perceiving Changeful \nDuality as the Cause of Sorrow, they sought the Recon-\ncilement in Unity and in Stability. But I shew thee the \nUniverse as the Body of Our Lady Nuit, who is None \nand Two, with Hadit Her Lord as the Alternator of \nthose Phases. This Universe is then a perpetual By-\ncoming, the Vessel of every Permutation of Infinity, \nwherein every Phenomenon is a Sacrament, Change being \nthe Act of Love, and Duality the Condition prodromal to \nthat Act, even as an Axe must be taken back from a Cedar \nthat it may deliver its Stroke. The Error therefore of \nthese Philosophers lay in their false Assumption that \nBliss, Knowledge, and Being (the Qualities of their \nChangeless Unity) could be States. 0 my Son, how pitiful \nis their Beggary, these Paupers of Sense and of Experience \nand of Observation! The Emptiness of their Bellies was \nit that bred Phantoms of Ideal, so that they sought Joy \nby a Crude Denial of what Truth (or rather, Fact) they \nhad perceived concerning the Universe, so that they set \nup an Idol of Death for their God,  in very Rage of Hatred \nagainst the Sum of their own Selves. 200 \nDE HERESIA MANICHAEA \nTHESE Philosophers, or shall I not say Misosophers and \nPseudo-Sophists, have been hard put to it to explain \nthe Mystery of the Existence of their Evil. They have \ncried, frothing with Words, that Evil is Illusion. But if \nso, that Illusion is Evil; whence came it, and to what \nEnd? If their Devil created it, who created that Devil ? All their Contention resolveth to this Dilemma of Change \nin a Changeless, Falsity in a True, Hate in a Loving, \nWeakness in an Almighty, Duality in a Simple, Being as \nthey define their God. Nor do they see that they restrict \ntheir God (whom yet they would have to be All) by ad-\nmitting Opposites to his Nature, even when they sum \nthese Opposites as Illusion, since Illusion is the Denial \nof his Truth. But the Indians, seeing this, seek Escape \nby denying all Quality soever to their God, or True State, \nI speak of Parabrahman and of Nibbana, thus in any \nReality of Thought rather denying Him or It than destroy-\ning Illusion. But in our Light we have no need of any \nDenial, and accept All, yea, Illusion itself, discriminating \nonly in our Minds between Phenomena by Comparison \nwith some convenient Standard, for the Purpose of \nmaintaining the Order of our Conceptions in Respect of \nthe Relation of any Being with its Environment. 201 \nDE VERITATE CORUM MENSURANDA \nso do thou apprehend this Wisdom, o my Son, laying it \nto thine Heart, as a Mistress, and hiding it in the Treas-\nury of thy Mind as a Jewel of Enlightenment. Consider \na Dream, how it is unreal in Respect of thine Experience \nof the Objects of thy waking Sense, but real also, both as \nit did in Fact impress thy Mind, and as it did express in \narcane Token some Lust of thine Angel, as I have already \nshewed in this Letter. Consider the Play of the Chess, \nhow its Law hath made for itself a Language and a Liter-\nature, yet it is but an arbitrary Invention, without im-\npinging (save as it operateth through Pleasure and Inter-\nest upon Minds) on any other Sphere soever of the Uni-\nverse. Equally, Things called (vulgarly) Real and Ma-\nterial exist in the Universe of our Consciousness only by \nthe Apprehension of their Images in Mind through Sense; \nas, how is Colour Real or Material to a blind Man; or a \nLaw mathematical true to him that is imbecile or dement-\ned. All Things therefore, even if unreal and irrational, \nnay, inconceivable and impossible (such as Iota in the \nTheorem of De Moivre), exist in one Form or another; \nbut the Reality of any, though in itself absolute, is in \nRegard of its Relation with any other Thing dependent \nupon the Intercourse and Language between them, \nconscious or unconscious. Consider Azote, that hath nigh \nFour Parts in Five of the Air, how it is not real to direct \nPerception of any human Sense, but yet most real to \nour Lungs, diluting the Oxygen, by whose Love we were \nelse violently combust. This is the Measure of Reality. 202 \nDE APHORISMO UBI DICO : OMNIA STINT \nMY Son, long did I await thee, yearning, and with Pride \nand great Gladness did I bid thee Welcome to my \nCity of the Pyramids, under the Night of Pan. Now then \nin my dear Love of thee will I reveal this Secret of Wis-\ndom, which I wrote occultly in my last Chapter, in these \nWords: All Things Exist. Considered by Right Under-\nstanding, this is to deny that there is any Thing imagin-\nable or unimaginable which doth not exist. That is, the \nBody of Our Lady Null hath no Limit, and there is no \nVoid that She filleth not with the Variety and Beauty of \nHer Stars in Her Space. Nor is there any one Law of \nHer Nature, but in Her are all Laws, so that each Thing \nor each Truth that thou perceivest is as it were one Ges-\nture of Her Dance. Shut up the Book of thy Questions, o \nmy Son, concerning Nature, her Way, her Origin, or her \nPurpose, except in those Matters which concern thee and \nthine own Orbit, o thou Star, begotten of my Loins in my \nLust of Hilarion, the Golden Rose, mystic and joyous, the \nLily of a Thousand Petals and One Petal, subtle and per-\nverse, that thou mightest fulfil this Work of a Magus \nwhich I came to accomplish, robing myself in Flesh of \nMan, as was my Nature and the Will of my Nature, the \nName of my Star that flameth in the Body of Nuit Our \nLady. 203 \nDE RATIONE HUJUS EPISTOLAE SCRIBENDAE \nBEHOLD, I draw unto the End of this Discourse of \nWisdom, as a Ship that hath adventured upon Ocean, \nfrom whose Mast the Watcher espieth in the Dimness of \nthe Horizon a Point of Snow, being the Peak of a Great \nMountain that is Guardian of the Harbour, the Term of \nthat Voyage. So now do I commit thee wholly unto thy-\nself, for I exist not in thine Universe save in my Relation \nwith thee ; wherefore that Part of me is in Truth thou \nrather than I. Yet do thou treasure this Letter, for it is \nmine Especial Gift, and hath Radiance of the Light of my \nWisdom, and flameth, being the Blood of my Love of thee \nand of Mankind. Also, it is as the Pulse of my Life, beat-\ning with the Nature thereof ; and it is the Word of my \nWill, the Charter of the Liberty of my Soul, and thine, \nand that of every Man and every Woman; for we are \nStars. 0 my Son, for many Days was I silent, until thou \nwast fearful lest thou hadst, in Ignorance or by Inad-\nvertence, enkindled the Fire of my Wrath. But I spake \nnot, because I knew in my Wisdom that thou must pass \na certain Ordeal of thine Initiation by thine own Virtue. For this Cause I held aloof; but in my Love I made a \nBeginning of this Letter, beholding thy Triumph afore-\nhand, and with Prescience, divining thy next Need, that \nis to say, this Book of the Words of my Wisdom. 204 \nDE NATURA HUJUS EPISTOLAE \nn  MY Son, in this Letter have I written the Name of my \nown Nature, its Law, its Quality, its Will, and its Ap-\npurtenance or Ornament. For it is the Child of my Love \ntoward thee, and the Expression through mine Art of my \nWill so far as that regardeth thee. Now every Child is \nmade of the Essence of his Father, so that every Creation \nis a Likeness or Image of the Creator, but modified by \nthe Mother, that is to say, the Material whereon he be-\ngetteth it. So then this Letter is a Projection of mine \nown Star in a Mirror, to wit, mine Idea in thy Regard; \nand it shall be unto thee as a clear Vision of thy Father, \nand of the Word of the Aeon that he hath uttered unto \nMan. But also, because this Word is the Formula of the \nAeon, that is to say the Law of its Changes or Phenomena, \nthe Equation that expresseth its Energy and its Motion. it shall serve every Man in his Measure as a Text-Book \nor Comment upon the Theorick and Praxis of Magick. By it may he discover his own Nature, and its Will, and \napply his Force and his Intelligence to the Right Fulfil-\nment thereof. It shall be a Beacon to enlighten him, to \ncomfort him, and to direct him; and it shall be a Witness \nand Memorial of my Word and of my Work, as of mine \nAttainment unto Wisdom. 205 \nDE MODO QUO HANC EPISTOLAM SCRIPSI \nTHERE is not one Word in this Letter that is not writ \nwith mine own Hand and Style, slowly and heedfully \n(as is contrary with my Custom), being the Fruit of the \nTree of my Meditation, well-ripened by the Sun of mine \nIllumination. With much Toil have I done this, being \noftentimes seated without Motion save of the Hands, while \nEarth rolled in Shadow from Twilight unto Twilight, so \nthat my Body became cold and rigid, even as is a Corpse. Also, in the Intervals of this Scripture, have I been given \nto Contemplation and to Works of High Magick, notably \nthe Mass of the Holy Ghost, in the Concentration of my \nWill to impart this Wisdom unto thee, and to reveal the \nMysteries of Truth. Now of all these this is the Root, \nthat Truth is not fixed with the Rigour of Death, but \nvital with Lust of Change, and enflamed with the Love \nof its Opposite. Thus even Falsehood is not alien to \nTruth, for the Perfection of Nature comprehendeth All. But all these Things are written in the Book of the Law, \nafter which do I limp painfully, afar off, upon the poor \nCrutch of mine Understanding of its Word; yea, I am well \nassured that in that Book are writ All Things soever ; \nbut we, being mostly without Wit, are not able to distin-\nguish them. For the Stature of Aiwass is beyond our \nMeasure, seeing that He was able to comprehend the \nwhole Mystery of Nuit and of Hadit, and yet to declare \nTheir Message in the Languagie of Men. 206 \nDE SAPIENTIA ET STTJLTITIA \no MY Son, in this the Colophon of mine Epistle will I \nrecall the Title and Superscription thereof ; that is, \nthe Book of Wisdom or Folly. I proclaim Blessing and \nWorship unto Nuit Our Lady and Her Lord Hadit, for \nthe Miracle of the Anatomy of the Child Ra-Hoor-Khuit, \nas it is shewed in the Design Minutum Mundum, the Tree \nof Life. For though Wisdom be the Second Emanation \nof His Essence, there is a Path to separate and to join \nthem, the Reference thereof being Aleph, that is One \nindeed, but also an Hundred and Eleven in his full Orthog-\nraphy; to signify the Most Holy Trinity, and by Meta-\nthesis it is Thick Darkness, and Sudden Death. This is \nalso the Number of AUM, which is AMOUN, and the \nRoot-Sound of OMNE, or, in Greek, PAN, and it is a \nNumber of the Sun. Yet is the Atu of Thoth that corres-\npondeth thereunto marked with ZERO, and its Name is \nMAT, whereof I have spoken formerly, and its Image is \nThe Fool. 0 my Son, gather thou all these Limbs to-\ngether into one Body, and breathe upon it with thy Spirit, \nthat it may live ; then do thou embrace it with Lust ot \nthy Manhood, and go in unto it, and know it ; so shall ye \nbe One Flesh. Now at last in the Reinforcement and \nEcstasy of this Consummation thou shalt wit by what \nInspiration thou didst choose thy Name in the Gnosis, I \nmean PARZIVAL, \"der reine Thor\", the True Knight \nthat won Kingship in Monsalvat, and made whole the \nWound of Amfortas, and ordered Kumlry to Right Serv-\nice, and regained the Lance, and revived the Miracle of \nthe Sangraal ; yea, also upon himself did he accomplish \nhis Work in the End: \"Hoechsten Heiles Wunder! Er-\nloesung dem Erloeser!\" This is the last Vord of the Song \nthat thine Uncle Richard Wagner made for Worship of \nthis Mystery. Understand thou this, o my Son, as I take \nLeave of thee in this Epistle, that the Summit of Wisdom \nis the Opening of the Way that leadeth unto the Crown \nand Essence of all, to the Soul of the Child Horus, the \nLord of the Aeon. This Way is the Path of the Pure Fool. 207 \nDE ORACULO SUMMO \nAND who is this Pure Fool? Lo, in the Sagas of old \nTime, Legend of Scald, of Bard, of Druid, cometh he \nnot in Green like Spring? 0 thou Great Fool, thou \nWater that art Air, in whom all Complex is resolved! Yea, Thou in ragged Raiment, with the Staff of Priapus \nand the Wineskin ! Thou standest up on the Crocodile \nlike Hoor-pa-Kraat; and the Great Cat leapeth upon \nThee! Yea, and more also, I have known Thee who Thou \nart, Bacchus Diphues, none and two, in thy Name IAO! Now at the End of all do I come to the Being of Thee, \nbeyond By-coming, and I cry aloud My Word, as it was \ngiven unto Man by thine Uncle Alcofribas Nasier, the \nOracle of the Bottle of BACBUC, and this Word is \nTRINC. But in the antient right Spelling this is TRINU \nwhereof the Number is the Number of the Name of Me \nthy Father! to wit, Six Hundred and Three Score and Six.

According to this veil the numbers 0-10 \ncontain the root formulae for creation in this Universe. These numbers are true symbols in that they are inter-\nchangeable with the thing symbolized. Every number or \ncombination of numbers, then, has specific significance \nand meaning. Crowley was, of course, very aware of this \nfact and iised it accordingly. In several of his books\u2014\nmost particularly Wisdom or Folly and The Book of Lies\u2014\nthe information on each page stands in direct relationship \nto the number of the page itself. This makes the book \nespecially susceptible to divination. It is understood that the petitioner creates the oracle \nand that any book can be an oracle. But here the book has \nbeen Magickally formulated for such a purpose and the \n\"Magickal Link\" is stronger and truer than with an ordi-\nnary book. The oracle may be used in any number of ways. It may simply be opened to a page and read. A \"found\" \nnumber can be used for the divination. Another excellent \nmethod is to add up the numerical value of a tarot spread \nand consult that page for additional information. Liber Aleph, The Book of Wisdom or Folly, is a book of \npractical information. Any way you use it is for the good \nof All. "
